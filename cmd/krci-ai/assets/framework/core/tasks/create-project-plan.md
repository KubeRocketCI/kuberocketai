# Task: Create Project Plan

## Description

Create a comprehensive project management plan that integrates all subsidiary management plans and baselines to guide project execution, monitoring, and control. Following PMBoK standards, the project management plan defines how the project will be executed, monitored, controlled, and closed. This document serves as the primary source for managing the project and is progressively elaborated throughout the project lifecycle.

## Prerequisites

- [ ] Project charter approved and available at `/docs/project-management/project-charter.md`
- [ ] Scope of Work completed at `/docs/project-management/scope-of-work.md`
- [ ] Project team identified and roles defined
- [ ] Resource availability and constraints understood
- [ ] Organizational policies and procedures reviewed

### Reference Assets

Dependencies:

- ./.krci-ai/data/common/sdlc-framework.md
- ./.krci-ai/data/project-management-methodology.md
- ./.krci-ai/templates/project-plan-template.md
- /docs/project-management/project-charter.md (approved charter)
- /docs/project-management/scope-of-work.md (approved SoW)

Validation: Verify all dependencies exist at specified paths before proceeding. HALT if any missing.

## Instructions

1. **Reference foundational documents**: Build on project charter and scope of work
2. **Follow PMBoK planning processes**: Apply PMBoK project management planning process group
3. **Integrate subsidiary plans**: Include schedule, cost, quality, resource, communication, risk, and procurement management plans
4. **Follow SDLC workflow**: Reference [sdlc-framework.md](./.krci-ai/data/common/sdlc-framework.md) for artifact dependencies
5. **Use business frameworks**: Apply methodologies from [business-frameworks.md](./.krci-ai/data/business-frameworks.md)
6. **Format output**: Use [project-plan-template.md](./.krci-ai/templates/project-plan-template.md) for consistent structure

## Output Format

- **Location**: `/docs/project-management/project-plan.md` (EXACT path and filename)
- **Length**: 10-20 pages depending on project complexity
- **Downstream Enable**: Enables project execution, monitoring, and control activities

## Success Criteria

- [ ] **File saved** to `/docs/project-management/project-plan.md`
- [ ] **Project management approach** clearly defined
- [ ] **Schedule baseline** established with milestones and deliverables
- [ ] **Cost baseline** defined with budget allocations
- [ ] **Quality management plan** included with standards and metrics
- [ ] **Resource management plan** with team structure and responsibilities
- [ ] **Communication management plan** with stakeholder engagement strategy
- [ ] **Risk management plan** with identified risks and responses
- [ ] **Change management process** defined and documented
- [ ] **Configuration management** approach specified

## Execution Checklist

### Foundation Phase

- [ ] **Charter analysis**: Review project charter for objectives and constraints
- [ ] **SoW integration**: Incorporate scope definition and WBS from SoW
- [ ] **Stakeholder identification**: Identify all stakeholders and their requirements
- [ ] **Organizational analysis**: Review organizational process assets and environmental factors

### Planning Phase

- [ ] **Schedule development**: Create detailed project schedule with critical path
- [ ] **Resource planning**: Define resource requirements and allocation
- [ ] **Cost estimation**: Develop detailed cost estimates and budget
- [ ] **Quality planning**: Define quality standards, metrics, and control processes

### Integration Phase

- [ ] **Plan integration**: Integrate all subsidiary management plans
- [ ] **Baseline establishment**: Establish scope, schedule, and cost baselines
- [ ] **Change control setup**: Define change control board and processes
- [ ] **Configuration management**: Define configuration management procedures

### Documentation Phase

- [ ] **Plan creation**: Use [project-plan-template.md](./.krci-ai/templates/project-plan-template.md) structure
- [ ] **Content validation**: Ensure all PMBoK required components are included
- [ ] **Stakeholder review**: Review plan with key stakeholders and team
- [ ] **File placement**: Save to exact location `/docs/project-management/project-plan.md`

### Approval Phase

- [ ] **Team validation**: Review plan with project team for feasibility
- [ ] **Stakeholder approval**: Obtain formal approval from sponsor and key stakeholders
- [ ] **Baseline approval**: Establish approved baselines for change control
- [ ] **Plan distribution**: Distribute approved plan to all stakeholders

## Content Guidelines

### Quality Principles for LLM Self-Evaluation

- **Comprehensive Coverage**: Include all PMBoK knowledge areas relevant to the project
- **Integration Focus**: Ensure all subsidiary plans work together coherently
- **Realistic Planning**: Base plans on actual constraints and available resources
- **Measurable Objectives**: Define specific, measurable objectives and success criteria

### LLM Error Prevention Checklist

- **Avoid**: Generic templates without project-specific customization
- **Avoid**: Unrealistic schedules or resource allocations
- **Avoid**: Missing integration between subsidiary plans
- **Avoid**: Undefined change control or configuration management processes
- **Reference**: Use [project-plan-template.md](./.krci-ai/templates/project-plan-template.md) for all formatting guidance

### PMBoK Integration Context

The Project Management Plan integrates all PMBoK knowledge areas by including subsidiary management plans for scope, schedule, cost, quality, resource, communication, risk, procurement, and stakeholder management. This plan establishes the performance measurement baseline and guides project execution and control activities.
