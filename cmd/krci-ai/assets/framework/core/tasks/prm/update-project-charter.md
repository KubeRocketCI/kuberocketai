# Task: Update Project Charter

## Description

Update an existing project charter to reflect approved changes, new information, or evolving project requirements while maintaining the charter's role as the formal project authorization document. Charter updates follow integrated change control processes per PMBoK standards and require appropriate stakeholder review and approval.

## Instructions

<instructions>
Confirm existing project charter is available for modification, change request or update rationale is documented, stakeholder approval for charter modifications is obtained, impact assessment of proposed changes is completed, and version control process is established. Ensure dependencies declared in the YAML frontmatter ([project-management-methodology.md](./.krci-ai/data/prm/project-management-methodology.md) and [project-charter-template.md](./.krci-ai/templates/prm/project-charter-template.md)) are readable before proceeding.

Analyze change request or update rationale thoroughly. Identify specific charter sections requiring modification. Assess impact on project scope, timeline, budget, and resources. Determine stakeholder communication and approval requirements. Evaluate effect on project objectives and success criteria. Assess impact on stakeholder roles and responsibilities. Review implications for resource allocation and Project Manager authority. Identify cascading effects on project planning and execution.
