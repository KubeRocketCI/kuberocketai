# Task: Create Risk Register

## Description

Create a comprehensive risk register that identifies, analyzes, and documents project risks along with their response strategies and ownership assignments. The risk register serves as the central repository for risk management throughout the project lifecycle, following PMBoK risk management principles and organizational best practices.

## Instructions

<instructions>
Confirm the exact output you will create using [risk-register-template.md](./.krci-ai/templates/prm/risk-register-template.md) and verify access to inputs (charter/scope, WBS, stakeholder data). Ensure YAML frontmatter dependencies are readable before proceeding.

Reference [project-management-methodology.md](./.krci-ai/data/prm/project-management-methodology.md) for PMBoK risk management principles. Conduct brainstorming sessions with project team and stakeholders, review project documentation for potential risk sources, analyze work breakdown structure for activity-specific risks, consider external factors and organizational constraints, and review lessons learned from similar projects.

Categorize identified risks across technical, schedule, cost, organizational, external, and quality dimensions. Assess probability of occurrence for each identified risk, evaluate potential impact on project objectives, use probability-impact matrix to prioritize risks, and consider risk interdependencies and cumulative effects using standard probability scales (Very Low 0.1 to Very High 0.9) and impact scales (Very Low to Very High).

Develop response strategies for negative risks including avoid, mitigate, transfer, or accept approaches. For positive risks, use exploit, enhance, share, or accept strategies. Define specific response actions and activities, assign risk owners and response responsibilities, establish trigger conditions and early warning indicators, determine resource requirements and budget allocations, and set timeline for response implementation.

Define risk status tracking and reporting procedures, establish risk review meeting schedule and participants, create risk escalation criteria and procedures, and develop risk communication and stakeholder notification protocols. Define risk response effectiveness measurement, establish residual risk acceptance criteria, create secondary risk identification and response procedures, and document risk register update and maintenance procedures.

Use the [risk-register-template.md](./.krci-ai/templates/prm/risk-register-template.md) to create comprehensive risk register with complete risk entries including ID, description, category, probability and impact assessments, response strategies, and ownership assignments.
