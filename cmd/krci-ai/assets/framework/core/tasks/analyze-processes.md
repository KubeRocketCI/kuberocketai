# Task: Analyze Processes

## Description

Analyze current business processes and workflows to identify improvement opportunities and document process requirements that support PRD enhancement and Epic definition. This task bridges current state operations with future state system requirements, providing process insights that inform business requirements (BR) and system design decisions for Epic implementation and Story development.

## Prerequisites

<prerequisites>
- PRD foundation: PRD exists at `/docs/prd/prd.md` with initial business context and objectives
- Process scope defined: Business process boundaries and analysis objectives established
- Stakeholder access: Process participants and process owners available for interviews
- Analysis tools: Process mapping tools and performance measurement capabilities prepared
</prerequisites>

### Reference Assets

Dependencies:

- ./.krci-ai/data/krci-ai/core-sdlc-framework.md
- ./.krci-ai/data/analysis-methodologies.md
- ./.krci-ai/templates/process-map.md

CRITICAL: Load all dependencies by reading their complete content before task execution. HALT if any missing.

## Instructions

<instructions>
1. Follow SDLC workflow: Reference [sdlc-framework.md](./.krci-ai/data/krci-ai/core-sdlc-framework.md) for process analysis dependencies and workflow
2. Apply analysis methodologies: Use techniques from [analysis-methodologies.md](./.krci-ai/data/analysis-methodologies.md)
3. Format output: Use [process-map.md](./.krci-ai/templates/process-map.md) for workflow documentation
4. Connect to PRD: Identify how process improvements map to PRD requirements and Epic features
5. Create comprehensive analysis: Generate detailed process insights with extensive business context and strategic reasoning
6. Provide implementation guidance: Include specific recommendations for process optimization and system integration
7. Integrate with framework: Ensure process improvements support Epic development and Story creation
8. Template compliance: Follow process-map.md template structure and populate all variables correctly
</instructions>

## Output Format

**Process Analysis Documentation** - Create comprehensive process insights:

- [ ] **Current state documentation**: Process maps and performance analysis using [process-map.md](./.krci-ai/templates/process-map.md) template
- [ ] **Gap analysis report**: Performance gaps, improvement opportunities, and optimization recommendations
- [ ] **Future state design**: Optimized process flows that address identified inefficiencies
- [ ] **PRD enhancement guidance**: Process insights that inform PRD BR/NFR requirements and Epic features

</success_criteria>

## Execution Checklist

<current_state_analysis>
- Process discovery: Map complete process flows from start to end, identifying all participants and touchpoints
- Performance measurement: Collect process metrics including cycle time, throughput, error rates, and resource utilization
- Stakeholder interviews: Conduct sessions with process participants to understand current workflows and pain points
- Documentation review: Analyze existing process documentation, procedures, and system configurations
</current_state_analysis>

<process_analysis>
- Performance gap analysis: Compare current vs. desired performance metrics and identify bottlenecks
- Value stream mapping: Classify activities as value-add, non-value-add, or necessary non-value-add
- Root cause analysis: Apply analytical techniques to identify underlying causes of process inefficiencies
- Opportunity identification: Document automation opportunities, streamlining potential, and optimization areas
</process_analysis>

<future_state_design>
- Process optimization: Design improved workflows that eliminate waste and streamline operations
- Technology integration: Identify how system solutions can support optimized processes
- Role redefinition: Define new responsibilities and process interactions for optimized workflows
- Implementation planning: Create roadmap for process transformation aligned with Epic development
</future_state_design>

<prd_integration>
- Requirements mapping: Connect process improvements to specific PRD BR/NFR requirements
- Epic guidance creation: Structure process insights to inform Epic features and acceptance criteria
- Benefits quantification: Document measurable business benefits from process optimization
- Implementation alignment: Ensure process improvements support Epic breakdown and Story development
</prd_integration>

## Content Guidelines

<content_guidelines>

### Process Documentation Structure

#### Current State Process Mapping

- Process Flow: Step-by-step workflow with decision points and handoffs
- Performance Metrics: Cycle time, throughput, error rates, and resource costs
- Pain Points: Identified inefficiencies, bottlenecks, and improvement opportunities
- Stakeholder Impact: How current process affects different user groups and business stakeholders

#### Future State Process Design

- Optimized Workflow: Streamlined process with eliminated waste and improved efficiency
- Technology Enablement: How system solutions support improved processes
- Benefits Realization: Quantified improvements in performance metrics and business outcomes
- Epic Implementation: How process improvements translate into Epic features and Story requirements
</content_guidelines>

<quality_standards>
- Stakeholder Validated: Process analysis reviewed and approved by process owners and participants
- Performance Measured: Current state documented with quantifiable metrics and benchmarks
- Improvement Focused: Clear identification of optimization opportunities with business justification
- PRD Aligned: Process insights enhance PRD requirements and inform Epic development
- Implementation Ready: Process improvements structured to support Epic breakdown and Story creation
</quality_standards>

<common_pitfalls>
- Documenting ideal processes instead of actual current state workflows
- Missing quantitative performance data and relying only on qualitative feedback
- Focusing only on technology solutions without considering process optimization
- Inadequate stakeholder engagement and process participant validation
- Poor connection between process improvements and system requirements
</common_pitfalls>

<epic_development_enablement>
This process analysis should enable immediate Epic creation by providing:

- Process requirements that translate into Epic features and system capabilities
- Performance targets that become Epic acceptance criteria and success metrics
- User workflows that inform Epic user stories and interaction design
- Business benefits that guide Epic prioritization and implementation sequencing
</epic_development_enablement>
