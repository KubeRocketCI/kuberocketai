# Task: Map User Journeys

## Description

Create comprehensive user journey maps that visualize user experiences and identify touchpoints, supporting PRD requirements and Epic feature definition with user-centric insights. This task translates user behaviors, emotions, and pain points into actionable requirements that inform business requirements (BR) and system design decisions, enabling user-focused Epic development and Story creation.

## Prerequisites

- [ ] **PRD foundation**: PRD exists at `/docs/prd/prd.md` with basic user and business context
- [ ] **User personas defined**: Customer segments or user types identified from requirements gathering
- [ ] **Business process understanding**: Current user workflows and touchpoints mapped
- [ ] **User research access**: Availability of user feedback, analytics data, and customer insights

### Reference Assets

Dependencies:

- ./.krci-ai/data/common/sdlc-framework.md
- ./.krci-ai/data/analysis-methodologies.md
- ./.krci-ai/templates/user-journey.md

Validation: Verify all dependencies exist at specified paths before proceeding. HALT if any missing.

## Instructions

1. **Follow SDLC workflow**: Reference [sdlc-framework.md](./.krci-ai/data/common/sdlc-framework.md) for user journey mapping workflow and dependencies
2. **Apply analysis methodologies**: Use approaches from [analysis-methodologies.md](./.krci-ai/data/analysis-methodologies.md)
3. **Format output**: Use [user-journey.md](./.krci-ai/templates/user-journey.md) for structured journey documentation
4. **Support Epic/Story creation**: Ensure journey maps inform Epic features and Story acceptance criteria

## Output Format

**User Journey Documentation** - Create comprehensive user experience insights:

- [ ] **Journey maps**: Complete user journey documentation using [user-journey.md](./.krci-ai/templates/user-journey.md) template
- [ ] **Touchpoint analysis**: Detailed evaluation of user interactions and experience quality
- [ ] **Pain point identification**: Prioritized list of user friction areas and improvement opportunities
- [ ] **Epic guidance**: Journey insights structured to inform Epic features and Story requirements

## Success Criteria

- [ ] **Journey mapped comprehensively** - End-to-end user experiences documented with all touchpoints identified
- [ ] **Pain points prioritized** - User friction areas identified with business impact assessment
- [ ] **Emotional journey captured** - User emotions, motivations, and satisfaction levels documented
- [ ] **Improvement opportunities defined** - Actionable recommendations for experience optimization
- [ ] **Epic enablement provided** - Journey insights structured to support Epic feature development
- [ ] **PRD enhanced** - User journey findings integrated into PRD requirements and acceptance criteria

## Execution Checklist

### Journey Preparation Phase

- [ ] **Journey scope definition**: Identify specific user journeys to map with clear start and end points
- [ ] **Persona alignment**: Confirm user personas and segments for journey mapping focus
- [ ] **Data collection**: Gather existing user research, analytics, feedback, and support insights
- [ ] **Stakeholder engagement**: Schedule sessions with customer-facing teams and user representatives

### Journey Research Phase

- [ ] **User interviews**: Conduct sessions with actual users to understand experiences and pain points
- [ ] **Behavioral analysis**: Review usage analytics and customer interaction data
- [ ] **Touchpoint identification**: Map all user interaction points across digital and physical channels
- [ ] **Experience documentation**: Capture user actions, emotions, and satisfaction at each journey stage

### Journey Analysis Phase

- [ ] **Experience rating**: Evaluate touchpoint quality and user satisfaction scores
- [ ] **Pain point prioritization**: Identify and rank user friction areas by frequency and impact
- [ ] **Emotional mapping**: Document user emotional journey and critical decision moments
- [ ] **Opportunity identification**: Define improvement opportunities with business impact assessment

### Epic Integration Phase

- [ ] **Requirements mapping**: Connect journey insights to specific PRD BR/NFR requirements
- [ ] **Feature guidance**: Structure journey findings to inform Epic features and capabilities
- [ ] **Story preparation**: Provide user journey context that supports Story creation and acceptance criteria
- [ ] **PRD enhancement**: Integrate journey insights into PRD to strengthen user-focused requirements

## Content Guidelines

### üìã **User Journey Structure:**

#### **Journey Documentation Components:**

- **User Persona**: Primary user type and context for the journey
- **Journey Goal**: What the user wants to accomplish
- **Journey Phases**: Key stages from awareness through completion
- **Touchpoints**: All interaction points (digital, physical, human)
- **User Emotions**: Feelings and satisfaction levels throughout journey
- **Pain Points**: Friction areas and barriers to success

#### **Experience Analysis:**

- **Satisfaction Scores**: Quantitative ratings for each touchpoint
- **Effort Assessment**: How difficult each step is for users
- **Moments of Truth**: Critical decision points that impact user success
- **Improvement Opportunities**: Prioritized recommendations for experience enhancement

### ‚úÖ **Quality Standards:**

- **User Validated**: Journey maps based on actual user research and behavioral data
- **Comprehensive Coverage**: All touchpoints and interaction channels included
- **Emotionally Aware**: User feelings and motivations captured throughout journey
- **Actionable Insights**: Clear improvement opportunities with business justification
- **Epic Enabled**: Journey findings structured to support Epic feature development
- **PRD Aligned**: Journey insights enhance user-focused requirements in PRD

### ‚ùå **Common Pitfalls to Avoid:**

- Mapping assumptions instead of real user behavior and feedback
- Focusing only on digital touchpoints while ignoring offline interactions
- Missing emotional aspects and user motivation throughout the journey
- Creating overly complex journey maps without clear actionable insights
- Failing to validate journey maps with actual user research and data
- Poor connection between journey insights and Epic/Story requirements

### üéØ **Epic Development Enablement:**

This user journey mapping should enable immediate Epic creation by providing:

- **User experience requirements** that translate into Epic features and capabilities
- **Pain point solutions** that become Epic acceptance criteria and success metrics
- **Touchpoint improvements** that inform Epic user interface and interaction design
- **User satisfaction targets** that guide Epic prioritization and implementation approach
