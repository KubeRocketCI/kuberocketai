# Task: Create Project Status Report

## Description

Create a comprehensive project status report that provides stakeholders with clear visibility into project progress, performance, risks, and upcoming activities. The status report serves as the primary communication vehicle for project performance information and supports informed decision-making throughout the project lifecycle.

## Instructions

<instructions>
Confirm the exact output format and distribution targets using [status-report-template.md](./.krci-ai/templates/status-report-template.md). Ensure all dependencies declared in the YAML frontmatter and required project data sources are accessible before proceeding.

Collect current performance data across schedule, cost, and scope, including SPI/CPI metrics, milestone progress, and variance details with clear data sources. Analyze progress objectively against baselines, documenting achievements, current status, and significant variances with root causes and corrective actions.

Update risk and issue status with trends, response effectiveness, and required decisions. Prepare the future outlook by listing upcoming activities, critical milestones, resource needs, and updated forecasts with assumptions and confidence.

Use the approved template structure and ensure clarity, accuracy, and completeness suitable for the intended stakeholders. Populate all template sections precisely.
