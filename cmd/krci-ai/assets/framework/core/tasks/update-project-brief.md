# Task: Update Project Brief

## Description

Update an existing project brief with new information, scope changes, or refined understanding while maintaining strategic alignment and enabling downstream SDLC artifacts. Focus on change impact assessment and downstream artifact management to ensure existing PRD and Epic artifacts remain aligned with strategic changes.

## Framework Context

**Reference**: [sdlc-framework.md](./.krci-ai/data/common/sdlc-framework.md) - See role responsibilities and artifact flow

## Prerequisites

- [ ] **Existing Project Brief**: `/docs/prd/project-brief.md` exists and is properly accessible
- [ ] **Change trigger**: Clear reason for update (strategic shifts, market changes, new insights, stakeholder feedback, resource changes)
- [ ] **Impact assessment**: Understanding of how changes affect dependent PRD and downstream artifacts
- [ ] **Stakeholder buy-in**: Key stakeholders aware of planned strategic changes

## Instructions

1. **Follow SDLC workflow**: Reference [sdlc-framework.md](./.krci-ai/data/common/sdlc-framework.md) for change impact assessment
2. **Use business frameworks**: Apply methodologies from [business-frameworks.md](./.krci-ai/data/business-frameworks.md)
3. **Format output**: Maintain [project-brief-template.md](./.krci-ai/templates/project-brief-template.md) structure
4. **Assess downstream impact**: Identify which PRD and Epic artifacts need updates

## Output Format

- **Location**: Updates existing `/docs/prd/project-brief.md` (EXACT path and filename)
- **Length**: Maintain 2-3 pages maximum
- **Impact Documentation**: Clear notes on what changed and downstream impact
- **Downstream Updates**: List of PRD/Epic artifacts requiring updates

## Success Criteria

- [ ] **File updated** at `/docs/prd/project-brief.md` reflects all changes
- [ ] **Change documented** with clear record of what changed and why
- [ ] **Downstream impact** identified which PRD/Epic artifacts need updates
- [ ] **Quality maintained** document remains 2-3 pages maximum
- [ ] **Strategic alignment** changes support overall product strategy
- [ ] **Stakeholder communication** key stakeholders informed of strategic changes

## Execution Checklist

### Assessment Phase

- [ ] **Change scope**: Identify which sections need updating (Executive Summary, Problem, Opportunity, Users, Success Metrics, Constraints, Risks)
- [ ] **Business impact**: Analyze how changes affect product strategy and business case
- [ ] **Downstream impact**: Evaluate how changes affect existing PRD (`/docs/prd/prd.md`) and subsequent artifacts
- [ ] **Stakeholder validation**: Confirm changes with key stakeholders

### Update Phase

- [ ] **Section updates**: Modify specific sections using [project-brief-template.md](./.krci-ai/templates/project-brief-template.md) structure
- [ ] **Strategic alignment**: Ensure updates maintain strategic coherence and business focus
- [ ] **Quality check**: Verify updated Project Brief maintains 2-3 page limit and foundation quality
- [ ] **Content validation**: Ensure all changes are properly integrated

### Change Management Phase

- [ ] **PRD impact analysis**: Determine if PRD needs updating based on Project Brief changes
- [ ] **Epic impact review**: Assess if strategic changes affect Epic prioritization or scope
- [ ] **Stakeholder communication**: Notify key stakeholders of strategic changes and implications
- [ ] **Documentation**: Record change rationale and downstream impact plan

## Change Management Guidelines

### üîÑ **Common Update Scenarios:**

1. **Market Changes**: Update Problem Statement with new market insights and competitive intelligence
2. **Resource Changes**: Update Constraints with new budget, timeline, or team changes
3. **User Insights**: Update Target Users with new research findings and behavior patterns
4. **Risk Changes**: Update Key Risks with new market or technology threats
5. **Business Context**: Update Executive Summary with new business priorities and strategic focus

### ‚úÖ **Update Best Practices:**

- **Strategic Focus**: Focus on strategic changes rather than tactical adjustments
- **Foundation Strength**: Ensure changes strengthen rather than weaken the overall foundation
- **Long-term View**: Consider long-term strategic implications beyond immediate changes
- **Cascade Management**: Manage strategic changes flowing through entire SDLC chain
- **Version Control**: Maintain proper change documentation and approval processes

### ‚ùå **Update Pitfalls to Avoid:**

- Making changes without clear strategic justification
- Updating without assessing downstream artifact impact
- Expanding scope beyond strategic foundation changes
- Missing stakeholder communication of strategic changes
- Breaking template structure during updates

### üéØ **Strategic Questions to Ask:**

- "What specific strategic changes are driving this update?"
- "How do these changes affect our core business case and value proposition?"
- "Which stakeholders need to approve these strategic changes?"
- "How do these changes impact the existing PRD and development roadmap?"
- "What downstream artifacts need updating to maintain alignment?"

### üìã **Downstream Impact Checklist:**

- [ ] **PRD Alignment**: Assess if PRD sections need updating to maintain alignment
- [ ] **Epic Review**: Check if strategic changes affect Epic prioritization or scope
- [ ] **Architecture Impact**: Determine if strategic changes affect system requirements
- [ ] **Timeline Impact**: Evaluate if changes affect project timeline or milestones
