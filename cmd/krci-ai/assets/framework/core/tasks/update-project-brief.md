# Task: Update Project Brief

## Description

Update an existing project brief with new information, scope changes, or refined understanding while maintaining strategic alignment and enabling downstream SDLC artifacts. Focus on change impact assessment and downstream artifact management to ensure existing PRD and Epic artifacts remain aligned with strategic changes.

## Prerequisites

- [ ] **Existing Project Brief**: `/docs/prd/project-brief.md` exists and is properly accessible
- [ ] **Change trigger**: Clear reason for update (strategic shifts, market changes, new insights, stakeholder feedback, resource changes)
- [ ] **Impact assessment**: Understanding of how changes affect dependent PRD and downstream artifacts
- [ ] **Stakeholder buy-in**: Key stakeholders aware of planned strategic changes

## Instructions

1. **Follow SDLC workflow**: Reference [sdlc-framework.md](./.krci-ai/data/common/sdlc-framework.md) for change impact assessment
2. **Use business frameworks**: Apply methodologies from [business-frameworks.md](./.krci-ai/data/business-frameworks.md)
3. **Format output**: Maintain [project-brief-template.md](./.krci-ai/templates/project-brief-template.md) structure
4. **Assess downstream impact**: Identify which PRD and Epic artifacts need updates

## Output Format

- **Location**: Updates existing `/docs/prd/project-brief.md` (EXACT path and filename)
- **Length**: Maintain 2-3 pages maximum
- **Impact Documentation**: Clear notes on what changed and downstream impact
- **Downstream Updates**: List of PRD/Epic artifacts requiring updates

## Success Criteria

- [ ] **File updated** at `/docs/prd/project-brief.md` reflects all changes
- [ ] **Change documented** with clear record of what changed and why
- [ ] **Downstream impact** identified which PRD/Epic artifacts need updates
- [ ] **Quality maintained** document remains 2-3 pages maximum
- [ ] **Strategic alignment** changes support overall product strategy
- [ ] **Stakeholder communication** key stakeholders informed of strategic changes

## Execution Checklist

### Assessment Phase

- [ ] **Change scope**: Identify which sections need updating (Executive Summary, Problem, Opportunity, Users, Success Metrics, Constraints, Risks)
- [ ] **Business impact**: Analyze how changes affect product strategy and business case
- [ ] **Downstream impact**: Evaluate how changes affect existing PRD (`/docs/prd/prd.md`) and subsequent artifacts
- [ ] **Stakeholder validation**: Confirm changes with key stakeholders

### Update Phase

- [ ] **Section updates**: Modify specific sections using [project-brief-template.md](./.krci-ai/templates/project-brief-template.md) structure
- [ ] **Strategic alignment**: Ensure updates maintain strategic coherence and business focus
- [ ] **Quality check**: Verify updated Project Brief maintains 2-3 page limit and foundation quality
- [ ] **Content validation**: Ensure all changes are properly integrated

### Change Management Phase

- [ ] **PRD impact analysis**: Determine if PRD needs updating based on Project Brief changes
- [ ] **Epic impact review**: Assess if strategic changes affect Epic prioritization or scope
- [ ] **Stakeholder communication**: Notify key stakeholders of strategic changes and implications
- [ ] **Documentation**: Record change rationale and downstream impact plan

## Content Guidelines

### Quality Principles for LLM Self-Evaluation

- **Strategic Focus**: Focus on strategic foundation changes rather than tactical adjustments
- **Foundation Strength**: Ensure changes strengthen rather than weaken the overall strategic foundation
- **Cascade Management**: Assess how strategic changes flow through entire SDLC chain to downstream artifacts
- **Long-term Alignment**: Consider long-term strategic implications beyond immediate tactical changes

### LLM Error Prevention Checklist

- **Avoid**: Making changes without clear strategic justification and stakeholder approval
- **Avoid**: Updating without assessing downstream PRD and Epic artifact impact
- **Avoid**: Expanding scope beyond strategic foundation changes into tactical details
- **Reference**: Use [project-brief-template.md](./.krci-ai/templates/project-brief-template.md) for all formatting consistency

### SDLC Integration Context

This update enables continued strategic alignment by managing strategic changes flowing through the entire SDLC chain, assessing PRD and Epic alignment impacts, ensuring stakeholder approval of strategic changes, and maintaining clear documentation of strategic change rationale and downstream artifact impact.
