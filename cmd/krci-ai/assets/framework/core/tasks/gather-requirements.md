   - Set up collaborative workshops

2. **Elicitation Techniques**
   - **Structured Interviews**: One-on-one sessions with key stakeholders
   - **Focus Groups**: Collaborative sessions with user groups
   - **Workshops**: Facilitated requirements gathering sessions
   - **Observation**: Process observation and job shadowing
   - **Document Analysis**: Review of existing processes and systems
   - **Prototyping**: Visual mockups to elicit feedback

### Phase 3: Requirements Documentation
1. **Functional Requirements**
   - User stories with acceptance criteria
   - Business rules and logic
   - Process flows and workflows
   - Data requirements and validation rules

2. **Non-Functional Requirements**
   - Performance requirements
   - Security and compliance needs
   - Usability and accessibility standards
   - Scalability and availability requirements

### Phase 4: Requirements Validation
1. **Review and Confirmation**
