# Task: Implement Feature

## Description

Implement Story requirements according to Architecture specifications and coding standards, ensuring quality and maintaining system consistency.

## Framework Context

**Reference**: [sdlc-framework.md](./.krci-ai/data/common/sdlc-framework.md) - See role responsibilities and artifact flow

## Prerequisites

- [ ] **Story available**: Specific Story exists in `/docs/stories/` with "Ready for Development" status
- [ ] **Tasks/Subtasks defined**: Story contains Tasks/Subtasks section with implementation checklists
- [ ] **Development environment**: Project codebase access and development tools configured
- [ ] **Coding standards**: Understanding of project coding standards and best practices

## Instructions

1. **Follow SDLC workflow**: Reference [sdlc-framework.md](./.krci-ai/data/common/sdlc-framework.md) for implementation dependencies and handoff requirements
2. **Apply coding standards**: Use guidelines from [coding-standards.md](./.krci-ai/data/coding-standards.md) and [best-practices.md](./.krci-ai/data/best-practices.md)
3. **Format output**: Use [implementation-plan.md](./.krci-ai/templates/implementation-plan.md) for planning and [code-review.md](./.krci-ai/templates/code-review.md) for reviews
4. **Ensure Story compliance**: Implement all Story acceptance criteria following Architecture specifications

## Output Format

**Story Implementation** - Transform Story requirements into working code:

- [ ] **Story status updates**: Status progression from "Ready for Development" ‚Üí "In Progress" ‚Üí "Done"
- [ ] **Code implementation**: Working code that meets all Story acceptance criteria
- [ ] **Test coverage**: Unit and integration tests validating Story requirements
- [ ] **Implementation documentation**: Updated Story file with implementation details and results

## Success Criteria

- [ ] **Story implemented completely** - All Story acceptance criteria met with working code
- [ ] **Architecture compliant** - Implementation follows Architecture specifications and design patterns
- [ ] **Quality validated** - Code passes all tests, meets coverage requirements, and follows coding standards
- [ ] **Story updated** - Story file updated with implementation details and status progression
- [ ] **System integration** - New code integrates properly with existing system without regressions
- [ ] **Documentation current** - Relevant documentation updated to reflect implementation changes

## Execution Checklist

### Story Selection and Preparation Phase

- [ ] **Story identification**: Locate specific Story in `/docs/stories/{epic_number}.{story_number}.story.md` or present available Stories for selection
- [ ] **Story validation**: Verify Story has "Ready for Development" status, clear acceptance criteria, and defined Tasks/Subtasks
- [ ] **Tasks/Subtasks review**: Examine Story's Tasks/Subtasks section for implementation checklist
- [ ] **Status update**: Change Story status to "In Progress" and add implementation start timestamp

### Implementation Planning Phase

- [ ] **Requirements analysis**: Parse Story acceptance criteria and identify all functional/non-functional requirements
- [ ] **Checklist review**: Review Tasks/Subtasks section for systematic implementation guidance
- [ ] **Task breakdown**: Follow existing Tasks/Subtasks checklist from Story
- [ ] **Implementation approach**: Use Story's Tasks/Subtasks as implementation roadmap

### Development Execution Phase

- [ ] **Checklist execution**: Systematically execute each item from Story's Tasks/Subtasks section
- [ ] **Code development**: Implement each Subtask following coding standards
- [ ] **Progress tracking**: Check off completed Subtasks in Story file for transparency
- [ ] **Quality assurance**: Run linting, formatting, and security checks per requirements

### Validation and Completion Phase

- [ ] **Subtask completion verification**: Ensure all Subtasks in Story's Tasks/Subtasks section are checked off
- [ ] **Acceptance criteria validation**: Test all Story acceptance criteria are met with working functionality
- [ ] **Testing plan execution**: Complete all Testing Plan checklist items from Story
- [ ] **Story completion**: Update Story status to "Done" with Implementation Results summary and completion timestamp

## Content Guidelines

### üéØ **Developer Focus Areas:**

#### **Story Checklist Execution (Primary Focus):**

- **Tasks/Subtasks**: Execute each checklist item systematically from Story's Tasks/Subtasks section
- **Architecture References**: Follow specific architecture sections linked in Story
- **Testing Plan**: Complete all testing checklist items defined in Story
- **Progress Tracking**: Check off Subtasks as completed for transparent progress

#### **Tasks/Subtasks Structure (Story-Driven):**

- **Approach**: Follow technical approach outlined in Story Tasks/Subtasks section
- **Architecture References**: Use Story-provided links to specific architecture sections
- **Tasks**: Execute main implementation tasks with their associated file lists
- **Subtasks**: Complete detailed checklist items under each Task systematically

### ‚úÖ **Quality Standards:**

- **Story Compliant**: All Story acceptance criteria implemented and validated
- **Architecture Aligned**: Implementation follows Architecture specifications and design patterns
- **Code Quality**: Meets coding standards, test coverage, and performance requirements
- **System Integrated**: No regressions, proper integration with existing functionality
- **Documented**: Story updated with implementation details and system documentation current

### ‚ùå **Common Pitfalls to Avoid:**

- Implementing features not defined in the Story acceptance criteria
- Ignoring Architecture specifications and making independent design decisions
- Insufficient testing or failing to validate all acceptance criteria
- Breaking existing functionality or creating system integration issues
- Poor code quality that doesn't meet project standards

### üéØ **Story-Architecture Integration:**

This implementation should demonstrate proper SDLC role separation:

- **Stories define WHAT** to implement (acceptance criteria, business functionality)
- **Architecture defines HOW** to implement (design patterns, technology choices, component structure)
- **Developer implements** Stories using Architecture guidance without defining business requirements
- **Quality validation** ensures Story requirements met through Architecture-compliant implementation
