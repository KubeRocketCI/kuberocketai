# Task: Update Risk Register

## Description

Update an existing risk register to reflect new risks, changes to existing risks, implementation of risk responses, and closure of resolved risks. Following PMBoK monitor risks process, the risk register is a living document that must be continuously updated throughout the project lifecycle to maintain an accurate view of project risk exposure and response effectiveness.

## Prerequisites

- [ ] Existing risk register located at `/docs/project-management/risk-register.md`
- [ ] Risk monitoring data available from project execution
- [ ] New risks identified through ongoing project activities
- [ ] Risk response implementation status tracked
- [ ] Stakeholder feedback on risk status collected

### Reference Assets

Dependencies:

- ./.krci-ai/data/common/sdlc-framework.md
- ./.krci-ai/data/project-management-methodology.md
- ./.krci-ai/templates/risk-register-template.md
- /docs/project-management/risk-register.md (existing register)
- /docs/project-management/project-plan.md (approved plan)
- /docs/project-management/scope-of-work.md (approved SoW)

Validation: Verify all dependencies exist at specified paths before proceeding. HALT if any missing.

## Instructions

1. **Review existing register**: Analyze current risk register for accuracy and completeness
2. **Apply monitor risks process**: Follow PMBoK monitor risks process for systematic updates
3. **Track response effectiveness**: Evaluate effectiveness of implemented risk responses
4. **Follow SDLC workflow**: Reference [sdlc-framework.md](./.krci-ai/data/common/sdlc-framework.md) for artifact dependencies
5. **Maintain consistency**: Use [risk-register-template.md](./.krci-ai/templates/risk-register-template.md) structure
6. **Document changes**: Track all changes with rationale and evidence

## Output Format

- **Location**: `/docs/project-management/risk-register.md` (UPDATE existing file)
- **Change tracking**: Document revision history with update rationale
- **Status tracking**: Update all risk statuses and response progress

## Success Criteria

- [ ] **Existing register reviewed** and current status assessed
- [ ] **New risks added** with complete analysis and response planning
- [ ] **Risk status updated** based on monitoring and project progress
- [ ] **Response effectiveness evaluated** and documented
- [ ] **Closed risks documented** with closure rationale
- [ ] **Risk scores updated** based on current probability and impact
- [ ] **Trigger conditions monitored** and response activation tracked
- [ ] **Risk owners updated** for any ownership changes
- [ ] **Change log maintained** with complete revision history
- [ ] **Integration maintained** with project plan and other documents
- [ ] **File updated** at `/docs/project-management/risk-register.md`

## Execution Checklist

### Status Review Phase

- [ ] **Current register review**: Analyze existing risk register for accuracy
- [ ] **Risk status assessment**: Review status of all identified risks
- [ ] **Response progress**: Evaluate progress on risk response implementation
- [ ] **Trigger monitoring**: Check if any trigger conditions have been met

### New Risk Identification Phase

- [ ] **Project change analysis**: Identify new risks from project changes
- [ ] **Environmental scanning**: Look for new external risks affecting project
- [ ] **Stakeholder feedback**: Gather new risk information from stakeholders
- [ ] **Issue escalation**: Promote relevant issues to risks if appropriate

### Risk Analysis Updates Phase

- [ ] **Probability reassessment**: Update probability based on current information
- [ ] **Impact reanalysis**: Reassess impact based on project changes
- [ ] **Risk score recalculation**: Update risk scores using current probability and impact
- [ ] **Priority reranking**: Adjust risk priority based on updated analysis

### Response Evaluation Phase

- [ ] **Effectiveness assessment**: Evaluate how well responses are working
- [ ] **Implementation progress**: Track progress on planned response activities
- [ ] **Cost tracking**: Monitor actual costs vs. planned risk response budget
- [ ] **Outcome measurement**: Measure actual risk reduction achieved

### Risk Closure Phase

- [ ] **Resolution verification**: Verify that resolved risks are truly closed
- [ ] **Closure documentation**: Document how and why risks were closed
- [ ] **Lessons learned**: Capture lessons learned from risk management
- [ ] **Historical update**: Update organizational risk knowledge base

### Documentation Update Phase

- [ ] **Register modification**: Update register using [risk-register-template.md](./.krci-ai/templates/risk-register-template.md)
- [ ] **Change documentation**: Document all changes with clear rationale
- [ ] **Version control**: Update version number and revision history
- [ ] **Integration check**: Ensure updates align with project plan and other documents

### Communication Phase

- [ ] **Stakeholder notification**: Communicate significant risk changes to stakeholders
- [ ] **Team updates**: Update project team on risk status changes
- [ ] **Sponsor reporting**: Report critical risk changes to project sponsor
- [ ] **File update**: Save updated register to `/docs/project-management/risk-register.md`

## Content Guidelines

### Quality Principles for LLM Self-Evaluation

- **Accuracy Maintenance**: Ensure all risk information reflects current project reality
- **Evidence-Based Updates**: Base all changes on factual information and data
- **Response Tracking**: Maintain clear tracking of response effectiveness
- **Continuous Improvement**: Use lessons learned to improve risk management

### LLM Error Prevention Checklist

- **Avoid**: Updating risks without proper evidence or justification
- **Avoid**: Closing risks prematurely without verification
- **Avoid**: Ignoring new risks that emerge during project execution
- **Avoid**: Failing to track response effectiveness and outcomes
- **Reference**: Use existing register structure and [risk-register-template.md](./.krci-ai/templates/risk-register-template.md)

### PMBoK Integration Context

Risk register updates follow PMBoK monitor risks process by tracking risk status, evaluating response effectiveness, identifying new risks, and updating risk analysis. Updated register maintains integration with project monitoring and control activities and informs decision-making for project adjustments and corrective actions.
