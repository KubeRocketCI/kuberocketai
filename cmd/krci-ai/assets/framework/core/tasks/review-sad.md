# Task: Review Architecture Documentation

## Description

Conduct comprehensive review of multi-file architecture documentation to ensure technical quality, PRD requirement compliance, and readiness for development implementation. This review validates that architecture meets enterprise standards and enables successful Epic/Story development across all architecture sections.

## Prerequisites

- [ ] **Completed architecture**: Architecture documentation exists in `/docs/architecture/` with sections following [sad-template.md](./.krci-ai/templates/sad-template.md) structure
- [ ] **Reference documents**: Access to PRD (`/docs/prd/prd.md`) and Epics (`/docs/epics/`) for validation
- [ ] **Architecture standards**: Understanding of organizational architecture principles and guidelines from [architecture-principles.md](./.krci-ai/data/architecture-principles.md)
- [ ] **Review criteria**: Clear understanding of quality gates and acceptance criteria

### Reference Assets

Dependencies:

- ./.krci-ai/templates/sad-template.md
- ./.krci-ai/data/architecture-principles.md
- ./.krci-ai/data/common/sdlc-framework.md
- ./.krci-ai/templates/architecture-review.md

Validation: Verify all dependencies exist at specified paths before proceeding. HALT if any missing.

## Instructions

1. **Follow SDLC workflow**: Reference [sdlc-framework.md](./.krci-ai/data/common/sdlc-framework.md) for quality gate requirements and review criteria
2. **Apply review standards**: Use [architecture-principles.md](./.krci-ai/data/architecture-principles.md) for quality assessment
3. **Format output**: Use [architecture-review.md](./.krci-ai/templates/architecture-review.md) for review documentation
4. **Validate traceability**: Ensure all PRD requirements and Epic features are addressed across architecture sections

## Output Format

- **Location**: `/docs/architecture/architecture-review-{date}.md` (EXACT path and filename)
- **Review outcome**: Clear PASS/FAIL determination with detailed findings for each architecture section
- **Issue documentation**: Specific issues found with actionable remediation guidance
- **Quality gate status**: Formal approval or rejection for implementation phase

## Success Criteria

- [ ] **Review completed** - Comprehensive assessment of all architecture sections documented per [sad-template.md](./.krci-ai/templates/sad-template.md) structure
- [ ] **Quality determination** - Clear PASS/FAIL decision with detailed rationale for each section
- [ ] **Issues documented** - Specific findings with actionable remediation steps
- [ ] **Traceability validated** - All PRD requirements verified as addressed across architecture sections
- [ ] **Standards compliance** - Architecture meets organizational standards and best practices
- [ ] **Implementation readiness** - Architecture provides sufficient guidance for development teams through 07-transition-migration.md

## Execution Checklist

### Document Review Phase

- [ ] **Completeness check**: Verify all 11 sections are present and no template variables remain
- [ ] **Content quality**: Assess technical accuracy, clarity, and professional presentation
- [ ] **Internal consistency**: Validate consistency between sections and architectural decisions
- [ ] **Standards compliance**: Ensure architecture follows organizational principles and guidelines

### Requirements Validation Phase

- [ ] **PRD traceability**: Verify every BR/NFR requirement is addressed in architecture
- [ ] **Epic alignment**: Confirm architecture supports all Epic implementations
- [ ] **Quality attributes**: Validate NFR requirements have specific architectural approaches
- [ ] **Constraint compliance**: Ensure architecture respects stated constraints and limitations

### Technical Assessment Phase

- [ ] **Architecture feasibility**: Assess technical viability of proposed solutions
- [ ] **Technology decisions**: Evaluate technology choices against requirements and standards
- [ ] **Risk assessment**: Identify architectural risks and validate mitigation strategies
- [ ] **Implementation guidance**: Confirm architecture provides clear development direction

### Quality Gate Phase

- [ ] **Review documentation**: Complete [architecture-review.md](./.krci-ai/templates/architecture-review.md) template
- [ ] **Decision rationale**: Document clear reasoning for PASS/FAIL determination
- [ ] **Issue prioritization**: Categorize findings by severity and implementation impact
- [ ] **Next steps**: Define clear action items for architecture improvement or approval

## Content Guidelines

### üìã **Review Focus Areas:**

1. **Section Completeness**: All 11 sections populated with relevant, project-specific content
2. **Requirements Coverage**: Every PRD BR/NFR requirement mapped to architectural components
3. **Epic Enablement**: Architecture provides clear implementation guidance for all Epics
4. **Quality Attributes**: NFR requirements addressed with specific architectural approaches
5. **Decision Quality**: Architectural decisions have clear rationale and consider alternatives
6. **Professional Standards**: Document meets enterprise architecture documentation standards

### ‚úÖ **PASS Criteria:**

- **Complete Documentation**: All 11 sections fully populated without template variables
- **Requirements Compliance**: 100% of PRD BR/NFR requirements addressed in architecture
- **Epic Support**: Architecture enables all Epic implementations with clear guidance
- **Quality Standards**: Document meets professional architecture documentation standards
- **Technical Feasibility**: Proposed architecture is technically sound and implementable
- **Decision Quality**: Architectural decisions are well-reasoned with clear alternatives

### ‚ùå **FAIL Criteria:**

- Missing or incomplete sections in SAD document
- PRD requirements not addressed or poorly mapped to architecture
- Insufficient implementation guidance for Epic/Story development
- Architectural decisions without clear rationale or alternatives
- Technical solutions that are not feasible or violate constraints
- Documentation quality below professional standards

### üîç **Common Review Issues:**

#### **Completeness Issues:**

- Template variables ({{variable}}) not replaced with project-specific content
- Sections missing or containing placeholder text
- Architectural diagrams missing or insufficient detail

#### **Requirements Issues:**

- PRD BR/NFR requirements not traced to architectural components
- New requirements introduced without PRD justification
- Quality attributes without specific implementation approaches

#### **Technical Issues:**

- Technology choices without clear rationale or trade-off analysis
- Architectural patterns that don't align with organizational standards
- Solutions that don't address stated constraints or limitations

### üéØ **Review Questions:**

Key questions to evaluate during review:

- "Are all PRD BR/NFR requirements clearly addressed in the architecture?"
- "Can development teams create Epics and Stories from this architecture guidance?"
- "Are architectural decisions well-reasoned with clear alternatives considered?"
- "Does the architecture meet organizational standards and best practices?"
- "Is the proposed solution technically feasible within stated constraints?"

### üìã **Quality Gate Checklist:**

- [ ] **Documentation Quality**: Professional presentation suitable for stakeholder review
- [ ] **Requirements Compliance**: All PRD requirements addressed with architectural solutions
- [ ] **Epic Enablement**: Clear implementation guidance for all Epic features
- [ ] **Technical Soundness**: Proposed solutions are feasible and well-architected
- [ ] **Standards Alignment**: Architecture follows organizational principles and guidelines
- [ ] **Decision Quality**: Major decisions have clear rationale and alternatives considered
