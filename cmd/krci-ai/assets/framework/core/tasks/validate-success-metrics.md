# Task: Validate Success Metrics

## Description

Apply SMART criteria and OKR alignment frameworks to validate success metrics quality, achievability, and strategic alignment. This validation ensures metrics are specific, measurable, achievable, relevant, and time-bound while supporting organizational objectives.

This validation uses [validation frameworks](./.krci-ai/data/validation-frameworks.md) and outputs results using the [validation report template](./.krci-ai/templates/validation-report-template.md).

## Instructions

<instructions>
Confirm project brief with success metrics section exists, baseline data or historical performance data is available, organizational OKR or strategic goals are documented, and industry benchmark data is accessible. Ensure dependencies declared in the YAML frontmatter are readable before proceeding.

Apply SMART criteria and OKR alignment frameworks from [validation-frameworks.md](./.krci-ai/data/validation-frameworks.md) to validate success metrics quality, achievability, and strategic alignment. Extract current success metrics from project brief including business metrics (revenue, cost savings, market share), user metrics (adoption, engagement, satisfaction), performance metrics (system performance, reliability), and operational metrics (efficiency, productivity). Use [validation-report-template.md](./.krci-ai/templates/validation-report-template.md) for output.

## Metrics Hypothesis Structure

```markdown
Success Metrics Hypothesis: {{project_name}} success measured by achieving:
- Business Impact: {{business_metric}} from {{baseline}} to {{target}} by {{date}}
- User Impact: {{user_metric}} from {{baseline}} to {{target}} by {{date}}
- Performance Impact: {{performance_metric}} from {{baseline}} to {{target}} by {{date}}

Specific Claims to Validate:
- Baseline measurements: {{baseline_claims}}
- Target achievability: {{target_claims}}
- Timeline feasibility: {{timeline_claims}}
- Measurement capability: {{measurement_claims}}
```

### Phase 2: SMART Criteria Validation Framework

#### SMART Assessment Process

For each success metric, evaluate against SMART criteria:

Specific Validation (1-5 scale):
- Is the metric clearly defined without ambiguity?
- Can stakeholders understand what exactly will be measured?
- Is the metric scope bounded and focused?
- Does the metric avoid vague or subjective language?

Measurable Validation (1-5 scale):
- Can the metric be quantified with specific numbers?
- Are measurement tools and data sources identified?
- Is the measurement process documented and reliable?
- Can progress be tracked throughout project lifecycle?

Achievable Validation (1-5 scale):
- Is the target realistic given available resources?
- Are there precedents for similar achievements?
- Have constraints and limitations been considered?
- Is the metric within team/organization control or influence?

Relevant Validation (1-5 scale):
- Does the metric align with business objectives?
- Will achieving this metric create meaningful value?
- Is the metric important to key stakeholders?
- Does the metric contribute to strategic goals?

Time-bound Validation (1-5 scale):
- Is there a clear deadline or timeframe?
- Are there intermediate milestones defined?
- Is the timeline realistic for metric achievement?
- Are dependencies and risks to timeline identified?

#### SMART Score Calculation

```
Total SMART Score = Specific + Measurable + Achievable + Relevant + Time-bound

Interpretation:
- 20-25: Excellent metrics, high confidence to proceed
- 15-19: Good metrics, minor refinement recommended
- 10-14: Moderate metrics, significant improvement needed
- <10: Poor metrics, fundamental revision required
```

### Phase 3: OKR Alignment Validation

#### Organizational Alignment Assessment

Objective Alignment:
- Does project objective align with company/department OKRs?
- Is the objective inspirational and directionally correct?
- Does the objective contribute to higher-level strategic goals?
- Is the objective clear enough to guide decision-making?

Key Result Quality:
- Are key results outcome-focused rather than activity-focused?
- Do key results collectively indicate objective achievement?
- Are key results ambitious yet achievable (60-70% confidence)?
- Do key results avoid measuring inputs or activities?

#### OKR Integration Analysis

```markdown
Company/Department OKR: {{higher_level_okr}}
Project Objective: {{project_objective}}
Alignment Score: {{alignment_score}}/10

Key Results Analysis:
KR1: {{key_result_1}}
- Outcome Focus: {{outcome_score_1}}/5
- Measurability: {{measurability_score_1}}/5
- Ambition Level: {{ambition_score_1}}/5
- Achievement Confidence: {{confidence_score_1}}%

KR2: {{key_result_2}}
- Outcome Focus: {{outcome_score_2}}/5
- Measurability: {{measurability_score_2}}/5
- Ambition Level: {{ambition_score_2}}/5
- Achievement Confidence: {{confidence_score_2}}%

Overall OKR Quality Score: {{okr_total_score}}/50
```

### Phase 4: Leading/Lagging Indicator Analysis

#### Indicator Balance Assessment

Leading Indicators (Predictive metrics):
- Identify metrics that predict future outcomes
- Validate correlation with historical data
- Assess controllability and actionability
- Define measurement frequency and reporting

Lagging Indicators (Outcome metrics):
- Identify metrics that measure final results
- Validate as true measures of success
- Assess measurement accuracy and reliability
- Define measurement and reporting process

#### Balanced Scorecard Creation

```markdown
Leading Indicators (Early Warning System):
1. {{leading_indicator_1}}: {{description}} (Frequency: {{frequency}})
2. {{leading_indicator_2}}: {{description}} (Frequency: {{frequency}})

Lagging Indicators (Success Measurement):
1. {{lagging_indicator_1}}: {{description}} (Frequency: {{frequency}})
2. {{lagging_indicator_2}}: {{description}} (Frequency: {{frequency}})

Predictive Relationships:
- {{leading_indicator}} correlates with {{lagging_indicator}} (RÂ² = {{correlation}})
- Time lag: {{time_lag_period}}
- Confidence in relationship: {{relationship_confidence}}%
```

### Phase 5: Evidence Collection and Validation

#### Baseline Data Validation

Data Collection Requirements:
- Historical performance data for achievability assessment
- Industry benchmark data for target calibration
- Measurement system reliability validation
- Data source accessibility and cost assessment

#### Benchmark Analysis

Industry Benchmarking:
- Identify relevant industry performance benchmarks
- Compare proposed targets with industry standards
- Assess competitive positioning implications
- Validate market expectation alignment

#### Measurement Feasibility Assessment

Technical Validation:
- Verify measurement tools and systems capability
- Assess data collection cost and complexity
- Identify measurement gaps and solutions
- Validate measurement accuracy and reliability
