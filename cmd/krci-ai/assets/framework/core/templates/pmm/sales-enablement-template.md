My goal is to understand your current AI development workflow and see if there's a fit with what we've built. Sound good? Tell me, how are your developers currently using AI tools in their daily work?"

Qualification Questions:
1. "How many developers do you currently have using AI tools?"

5. "If you could wave a magic wand and fix one thing about AI tooling, what would it be?"

DO:
- Use conversational, consultative language
- Ask open-ended questions that reveal pain points
- Listen more than you talk during discovery
- Build value before presenting solution

DON'T:
- Pitch product features without understanding needs
- Ask closed-ended yes/no questions

## Objection Handling

### Common Objections & Responses

#### "We're already using [Competitor Solution]"

**Response**: {{competitor_objection_response}}

#### "We don't have budget for this right now"

**Response**: {{budget_objection_response}}

#### "Our developers are used to their current tools"

**Response**: {{change_objection_response}}

#### "We need to see more enterprise features"

**Response**: {{enterprise_objection_response}}

#### "This seems too good to be true"

**Response**: {{skepticism_objection_response}}

#### "We need approval from security/compliance team"

**Response**: {{security_objection_response}}

#### "What if your company goes out of business?"

**Response**: {{business_continuity_objection_response}}

#### "Can we get a discount/pilot program?"

**Response**: {{pricing_objection_response}}

### Objection Handling Framework

**Step 1**: {{objection_step_1}}
**Step 2**: {{objection_step_2}}
**Step 3**: {{objection_step_3}}
**Step 4**: {{objection_step_4}}

<!-- Template Guidance:
Provide specific, proven responses to common sales objections.

Example:
Competitor Objection: "That's great that you're already using [competitor]. Many of our customers came from [competitor] because they were frustrated with [specific competitor weakness]. What's working well with [competitor] for your team? And what challenges are you facing?" [Listen, then bridge to your advantage] "The main difference our customers tell us is [specific differentiator with proof point]."

Budget Objection: "I understand budget is always a consideration. Let me ask you this - what's the cost of your developers spending 2 hours daily on AI tool setup and switching? At $100/hour developer cost, that's $200/day per developer in lost productivity. For a team of 20 developers, that's $1M annually in wasted time. Our platform typically pays for itself in the first month."

Objection Framework:
Step 1: "Acknowledge the concern" - "I understand why you'd want to be sure about [concern]"
Step 2: "Ask clarifying question" - "Help me understand what specifically concerns you about [issue]"
Step 3: "Provide relevant proof" - "Here's how [similar customer] addressed that same concern"
Step 4: "Confirm resolution" - "Does that address your concern about [issue]?"

DO:
- Acknowledge prospect's concerns as valid
- Ask questions to understand root concern
- Provide specific proof points and examples
- Confirm the objection is resolved before moving on

DON'T:
- Argue with or dismiss prospect concerns
- Give generic responses without listening
- Overwhelm with too much information
- Move on without confirming resolution

### Value Drivers

**Productivity Gains**:
{{productivity_value_drivers}}

**Cost Reductions**:
{{cost_reduction_value_drivers}}

**Risk Mitigation**:
{{risk_mitigation_value_drivers}}

<!-- Template Guidance:
Create compelling, conservative ROI calculations that prospects can defend internally.

Example:
Current State Costs:
- "Developer time waste: 2 hours/day per developer at $100/hour = $200/day per developer"
- "Tool setup and maintenance: 4 hours/week per team at $500/hour (senior dev) = $2,000/week"
- "Context switching productivity loss: 15% efficiency loss = $15,000/year per developer"

Small Team (10 developers):
"Current annual cost: $520,000 (productivity waste) + $104,000 (setup/maintenance) = $624,000
KubeRocketAI cost: $60,000 annually
Annual savings: $564,000
ROI: 940%
Payback: 1.2 months"

Value Drivers:
Productivity: "Eliminate 2 hours daily tool setup per developer, increase coding time by 25%"
Cost Reduction: "Reduce infrastructure costs by consolidating 10+ tools into one platform"
Risk Mitigation: "Enterprise security compliance built-in, reduce security audit costs"

DO:
- Use conservative assumptions prospects can defend
- Include multiple value drivers beyond cost savings
- Provide examples for different company sizes
- Show payback period and total ROI

DON'T:
- Use inflated or unrealistic savings numbers
- Focus only on hard cost savings
- Ignore implementation or training costs
