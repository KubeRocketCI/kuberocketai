## Requirements Analysis Workflow

### Phase 1: PRD Requirements Extraction

#### Business Requirements Identification

1. **Review PRD Document**: Extract all business requirements (BR1, BR2, BR3...)
2. **Categorize Requirements**: Group by functional area (authentication, user management, reporting)
3. **Identify Dependencies**: Map prerequisite relationships between requirements
4. **Validate Completeness**: Ensure all business needs captured as requirements

#### Non-Functional Requirements Identification

1. **Extract Quality Attributes**: Performance, scalability, security, availability requirements
2. **Define Metrics**: Establish measurable targets for each quality attribute
3. **Identify Constraints**: Technical, business, and resource limitations
4. **Validate Feasibility**: Ensure requirements are technically achievable

### Phase 2: Architectural Component Mapping

#### Component Identification

1. **Functional Decomposition**: Break requirements into logical components
2. **Responsibility Assignment**: Define clear component responsibilities
3. **Interface Definition**: Identify component interactions and dependencies
4. **Technology Alignment**: Match components to appropriate technologies

#### Implementation Approach Definition

1. **Technology Selection**: Choose specific technologies for each component
2. **Integration Patterns**: Define how components communicate
3. **Data Flow Design**: Map data movement through system
4. **Deployment Strategy**: Plan component deployment and scaling

### Phase 3: Epic/Story Alignment

#### Epic Breakdown Preparation

1. **Component-to-Epic Mapping**: Align architectural components with development Epics
2. **Story Creation Guidance**: Define story focus areas for each Epic
3. **Development Sequencing**: Plan implementation order based on dependencies
4. **Testing Strategy**: Align validation approach with Epic structure
