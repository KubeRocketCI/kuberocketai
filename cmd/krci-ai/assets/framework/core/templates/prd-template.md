# Product Requirements Document: {{product_name}}

## 1. Problem/Opportunity

<!-- Be crisp and clear about what user or business problem you're solving -->
<!-- AVOID: "User can't use [solution]" - this is NOT a problem statement -->
<!-- FOCUS: What issues are caused when functionality is missing? -->

{{problem_statement}}

**Evidence:**
{{supporting_evidence}}

<!-- Template Guidance:
Problem Example: "Users frequently forget passwords leading to 15% of support tickets and account lockouts (2,500/month). This creates frustration and consumes 15% of support resources."

Evidence Example: "User research shows 65% of users reset passwords monthly. Support ticket analysis reveals 2,500 password-related tickets costing $50K annually."
-->

## 2. Target Users & Use Cases

<!-- Always focus on the user - this aligns building with go-to-market -->
<!-- Be specific about users and use cases, ensure team alignment on definitions -->

**Primary Users:**
{{primary_users}}

**Key Use Cases:**
{{key_use_cases}}

<!-- Template Guidance:
Primary Users Example: "SaaS platform users (10,000+ monthly active) who access platform 3+ times weekly. Primary segment: business professionals aged 25-45 accessing from mobile (60%) and desktop (40%)."

Key Use Cases Example:
1. Daily login for work tasks (highest frequency)
2. Password recovery when locked out (highest pain)
3. Multi-device access synchronization (growing need)
-->

## 3. Current Journeys/Landscape *(Optional)*

<!-- Give context on what users do today or how competitors solve this -->
<!-- Quick summary + links to detailed materials -->

**Current User Journey:**
{{current_journey}}

**Competitive Landscape:**
{{competitive_analysis}}

<!-- Template Guidance:
Current Journey Example: "Users must remember complex passwords, leading to frequent lockouts. Recovery process takes 5-10 minutes via email verification."

Competitive Analysis: "Auth0, Okta provide enterprise solutions. Consumer apps use Face ID/Touch ID. Gap exists for SMB-focused authentication."

Links: "[Detailed user journey flow](link)" or "[Competitive analysis doc](link)"

## 4. Proposed Solution/Elevator Pitch

<!-- Standard 2-3 liner in plain English -->
<!-- Include top 3 MVP value props + conceptual model -->

**Elevator Pitch:**
{{elevator_pitch}}

**Top 3 MVP Value Props:**

1. {{value_prop_1}}
2. {{value_prop_2}}
3. {{value_prop_3}}

**Conceptual Model:**
{{conceptual_model}}

<!-- Template Guidance:
Elevator Pitch Example: "Enable users to login using biometric authentication (fingerprint/face) and social login options, reducing password dependency by 80% while maintaining enterprise security standards."

Value Props Example:
1. 3-second biometric login eliminates password frustration
2. Social login reduces new user signup friction
3. Enterprise security maintains compliance requirements

Conceptual Model: "[Include simple diagram or description of how users will interact with the solution]"
-->

## 5. Goals/Measurable Outcomes

<!-- Literally 2-3 bullets, no more -->
<!-- Measurable outcomes defining success or non-failure -->

**Success Metrics:**

1. {{success_metric_1}}
2. {{success_metric_2}}
3. {{success_metric_3}}

<!-- Template Guidance:
Success Metrics Example:
1. Reduce password-related support tickets by 80% within 3 months
2. Achieve 70% user adoption of new auth methods within 6 months
3. Improve login success rate from 85% to 95%

AVOID vague statements like "improve user experience" or "increase engagement"
-->

## 6. MVP/Functional Requirements

<!-- Critical: Focus on required functionality, save the rest for future phases -->
<!-- Question: What's the "min-viable" set of functionality for target user adoption? -->

### Business Requirements (BR)

**BR1**: {{business_requirement_1}}
**BR2**: {{business_requirement_2}}
**BR3**: {{business_requirement_3}}

### Non-Functional Requirements (NFR)

**NFR1**: {{system_requirement_1}}
**NFR2**: {{system_requirement_2}}
**NFR3**: {{system_requirement_3}}

<!-- Template Guidance:

Format: Focus on functionality, not implementation
✅ DO: "First-time user must accept privacy policy to use product"
✅ DO: "Product team can monitor and visualize user engagement"
✅ DO: Link to UX sketches for quick visualization
✅ DO: Include priorities: [P0] [P1] [P2] where P0 = truly required for MVP
✅ DO: Bucket by use case/user journey for Epic creation
✅ DO: Consider all critical user journeys (CUJs) - create, maintain, retire, navigate
✅ DO: Limit to 3 phases/milestones maximum

❌ DON'T: Performance metrics unless required for adoption
❌ DON'T: Design details like "blue 'Continue' button"
❌ DON'T: Technical implementation specifics

Business Requirements (BR) Examples:
BR1 [P0]: User can login using biometric authentication with <3 second response
BR2 [P1]: User can view login history with timestamps and device info
BR3 [P2]: Admin can configure password complexity requirements

Non-Functional Requirements (NFR) Examples:
NFR1 [P0]: System supports 1000 concurrent users with <2 second response time
NFR2 [P1]: System maintains 99.9% uptime during business hours
NFR3 [P2]: System integrates with enterprise SSO solutions

Use Case Buckets for Epic Creation:
### Epic 1: Authentication & Security
- BR1: Biometric authentication implementation
- NFR1: Performance and scalability requirements

### Epic 2: User Management
- BR2: User history and account features
- NFR2: System reliability requirements

Each bucket should map to an Epic following SDLC naming: {epic_number}-epic-{slug}.md
