# Security Framework for Architecture

## Security Principles

### Defense in Depth
Implement multiple layers of security controls.
- **Network Security**: Firewalls, VPNs, network segmentation
- **Application Security**: Input validation, authentication, authorization
- **Data Security**: Encryption at rest and in transit
- **Infrastructure Security**: Hardened systems, access controls

### Principle of Least Privilege
Grant minimum necessary permissions.
- **User Access**: Role-based access control (RBAC)
- **Service Access**: Service-to-service authentication
- **Data Access**: Column/row level security where needed

### Zero Trust Model
Verify every request, regardless of location.
- **Identity Verification**: Multi-factor authentication
- **Device Trust**: Device compliance and health checks
- **Network Segmentation**: Micro-segmentation

## Authentication Patterns

### Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)
Require multiple forms of verification.
- **Something you know**: Password, PIN
- **Something you have**: Token, smartphone
- **Something you are**: Biometrics

### Single Sign-On (SSO)
Centralized authentication for multiple applications.
- **Standards**: SAML, OAuth 2.0, OpenID Connect
- **Benefits**: User experience, centralized security policies

### API Authentication
Secure API access patterns.
- **API Keys**: Simple but limited security
- **JWT Tokens**: Stateless, contains claims
- **OAuth 2.0**: Delegated authorization

## Authorization Patterns

### Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)
Assign permissions based on user roles.
- **Roles**: Define job functions
- **Permissions**: Specific actions allowed
- **Assignment**: Users assigned to roles

### Attribute-Based Access Control (ABAC)
Fine-grained access control using attributes.
- **Subject Attributes**: User properties
- **Resource Attributes**: Data properties
- **Environment Attributes**: Time, location, risk

## Data Protection

### Encryption
Protect data confidentiality.
- **At Rest**: Database encryption, file system encryption
- **In Transit**: TLS/SSL, VPN tunnels
- **Key Management**: Centralized key management service

### Data Classification
Categorize data by sensitivity.
- **Public**: No restrictions
- **Internal**: Company confidential
- **Sensitive**: Personal data, financial data
- **Restricted**: Highly regulated data

### Data Loss Prevention (DLP)
Prevent unauthorized data exfiltration.
- **Content Inspection**: Scan for sensitive patterns
- **Policy Enforcement**: Block or quarantine violations
- **Monitoring**: Audit data access and movement

## Infrastructure Security

### Network Security
Protect network communications.
- **Firewalls**: Control network traffic
- **IDS/IPS**: Detect and prevent intrusions
- **VPN**: Secure remote access
- **Network Segmentation**: Isolate critical systems

### Container Security
Secure containerized applications.
- **Image Scanning**: Vulnerability assessment
- **Runtime Protection**: Monitor container behavior
- **Network Policies**: Control container communication

### Cloud Security
Secure cloud deployments.
- **IAM**: Identity and access management
- **Security Groups**: Network access control
- **Encryption**: Data protection in cloud
- **Monitoring**: Cloud security monitoring

## Security Monitoring

### SIEM (Security Information and Event Management)
Centralized security monitoring.
- **Log Collection**: Aggregate security events
- **Correlation**: Identify attack patterns
- **Alerting**: Real-time threat detection

### Vulnerability Management
Identify and remediate security vulnerabilities.
- **Scanning**: Regular vulnerability assessments
- **Patching**: Timely security updates
- **Risk Assessment**: Prioritize based on impact

## Incident Response

### Response Plan
Structured approach to security incidents.
1. **Preparation**: Establish response team and procedures
2. **Identification**: Detect and analyze incidents
3. **Containment**: Limit incident impact
4. **Eradication**: Remove threat from environment
5. **Recovery**: Restore normal operations
6. **Lessons Learned**: Improve future response

### Business Continuity
Maintain operations during security incidents.
- **Backup Systems**: Alternative processing capability
- **Data Recovery**: Restore critical data
- **Communication**: Stakeholder notification
