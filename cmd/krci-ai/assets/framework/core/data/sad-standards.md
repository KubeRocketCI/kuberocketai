- [ ] Decision status and ownership clearly identified

**ADR Template Compliance**:
```markdown
#### ADR-001: {{Decision Title}}
**Status**: Accepted/Proposed/Superseded
**Date**: {{YYYY-MM-DD}}
**Deciders**: {{Decision Makers}}

**Context**: {{Problem/situation requiring decision}}
**Decision**: {{Solution chosen}}
**Consequences**:
- Positive: {{Benefits and advantages}}
- Negative: {{Costs and limitations}}
**Alternatives Considered**: {{Other options and why rejected}}
```

## Review and Approval Standards

### Review Process Requirements

#### Mandatory Review Checkpoints
1. **Completeness Review**: All sections complete with quality content
2. **Technical Review**: Architecture technically sound and feasible
3. **SDLC Integration Review**: Epic/Story development guidance actionable
4. **Stakeholder Review**: Business alignment and value proposition validated

#### Review Quality Gates

**Gate 1: Document Completeness**
