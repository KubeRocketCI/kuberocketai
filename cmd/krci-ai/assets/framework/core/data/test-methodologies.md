# Test Methodologies and Technical Framework

## Testing Methodologies

### Agile Testing Methodology

Testing approach aligned with agile development practices.

- **Continuous Testing**: Integrate testing throughout development cycles
- **Sprint-based Testing**: Plan and execute testing within sprint cycles
- **Collaborative Testing**: Close collaboration between testers and developers
- **Adaptive Planning**: Adjust testing approach based on sprint outcomes

### Risk-Based Testing

Focus testing efforts based on risk assessment and impact analysis.

- **Risk Identification**: Systematic identification of potential risks
- **Risk Assessment**: Evaluate probability and impact of identified risks
- **Risk Prioritization**: Prioritize testing based on risk levels
- **Risk Mitigation**: Design tests to address highest priority risks

### Behavior-Driven Development (BDD)

Testing methodology focused on business behavior specification.

- **Given-When-Then**: Structure test scenarios using BDD format
- **Collaboration**: Involve business stakeholders in test definition
- **Living Documentation**: Tests serve as executable documentation
- **Automation**: Automate BDD scenarios for continuous validation

### Test-Driven Development (TDD)

Development approach where tests are written before implementation.

- **Red-Green-Refactor**: TDD cycle of failing test, implementation, refactoring
- **Unit Test Focus**: Emphasis on comprehensive unit test coverage
- **Design Validation**: Tests validate design decisions and implementation
- **Continuous Feedback**: Immediate feedback on code quality and functionality

## Test Design Techniques

### Black Box Testing Techniques

Testing based on functional specifications without knowledge of internal structure.

- **Equivalence Partitioning**: Divide input space into equivalent classes
- **Boundary Value Analysis**: Test at boundaries of input domains
- **Decision Table Testing**: Test combinations of input conditions
- **State Transition Testing**: Test system behavior across state changes

### White Box Testing Techniques

Testing based on internal code structure and implementation.

- **Statement Coverage**: Ensure all code statements are executed
- **Branch Coverage**: Test all decision branches in code
- **Path Coverage**: Test all possible execution paths
- **Condition Coverage**: Test all Boolean sub-expressions

### Gray Box Testing Techniques

Combination of black box and white box testing approaches.

- **Matrix Testing**: Combine functional and structural testing
- **Penetration Testing**: Security testing with partial system knowledge
- **Pattern Testing**: Testing based on common failure patterns
- **Hybrid Approach**: Mix functional and structural testing techniques

## Test Levels and Types

### Unit Testing

Testing individual components or modules in isolation.

- **Component Isolation**: Test individual units independently
- **Mock Dependencies**: Use mocks and stubs for external dependencies
- **Test Automation**: Automate unit tests for continuous execution
- **Code Quality**: Validate code quality and maintainability

### Integration Testing

Testing interactions between integrated components or systems.

- **Big Bang Integration**: Test all components together at once
- **Incremental Integration**: Gradually integrate and test components
- **API Testing**: Test application programming interfaces
- **Data Integration**: Test data flow between integrated systems

### System Testing

Testing complete integrated system against specified requirements.

- **End-to-End Testing**: Test complete business workflows
- **System Integration**: Test system-to-system interactions
- **Environment Testing**: Test in production-like environments
- **Performance Testing**: Validate system performance characteristics

### Acceptance Testing

Validate system meets business requirements and user expectations.

- **User Acceptance Testing**: Business users validate system functionality
- **Business Acceptance Testing**: Validate business process support
- **Alpha/Beta Testing**: Pre-release testing with limited user groups
- **Contract Acceptance**: Formal acceptance against contractual requirements

## Test Automation Framework

### Automation Strategy

Systematic approach to test automation implementation.

- **Automation Pyramid**: Balance unit, integration, and UI automation
- **ROI Analysis**: Evaluate return on investment for automation
- **Tool Selection**: Choose appropriate automation tools and frameworks
- **Maintenance Strategy**: Plan for test automation maintenance

### Automation Architecture

Design robust and scalable automation frameworks.

- **Modular Design**: Create reusable and maintainable test components
- **Data-Driven Testing**: Separate test logic from test data
- **Keyword-Driven Testing**: Abstract test actions into reusable keywords
- **Hybrid Framework**: Combine multiple automation approaches

### Continuous Integration Testing

Integrate automated testing into CI/CD pipelines.

- **Pipeline Integration**: Embed tests in deployment pipelines
- **Parallel Execution**: Run tests in parallel for faster feedback
- **Environment Management**: Manage test environments in CI/CD
- **Reporting Integration**: Integrate test results with CI/CD reporting

## Performance Testing Methodology

### Performance Test Types

Different types of performance testing for various objectives.

- **Load Testing**: Test system behavior under expected load
- **Stress Testing**: Test system behavior beyond normal capacity
- **Volume Testing**: Test system with large amounts of data
- **Spike Testing**: Test system response to sudden load increases

### Performance Test Process

Systematic approach to performance testing execution.

- **Requirements Analysis**: Define performance requirements and objectives
- **Test Planning**: Plan performance test approach and scenarios
- **Test Environment**: Set up realistic performance test environment
- **Test Execution**: Execute performance tests and collect data
- **Results Analysis**: Analyze performance data and identify bottlenecks

## Security Testing Methodology

### Security Test Approach

Comprehensive approach to security testing and validation.

- **Threat Modeling**: Identify potential security threats and vulnerabilities
- **Security Test Planning**: Plan security tests based on threat analysis
- **Penetration Testing**: Simulate real-world security attacks
- **Vulnerability Assessment**: Systematic identification of security weaknesses

### Security Testing Types

Different types of security testing for comprehensive coverage.

- **Authentication Testing**: Validate user authentication mechanisms
- **Authorization Testing**: Test access control and permission systems
- **Data Protection Testing**: Validate data encryption and protection
- **Input Validation Testing**: Test input sanitization and validation
