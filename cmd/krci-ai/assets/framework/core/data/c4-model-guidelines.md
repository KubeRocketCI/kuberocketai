# C4 Model Guidelines for Solution Architecture Documents

## Overview
The C4 model provides a hierarchical approach to software architecture diagramming, moving from high-level context through containers and components to code. This guide defines how to apply C4 modeling within Solution Architecture Documents for clear visual communication.

---

## C4 Model Hierarchy

### Level 1: System Context Diagrams
**Purpose**: Show how your system fits into the wider world in terms of people and other systems.

**When to Use**: Required in SAD Section 6.1 (Conceptual View)

**Elements**:
- **People**: The human users of your software system
- **Software Systems**: Your software system and external systems it interacts with
- **Relationships**: How people and systems interact

**Mermaid Implementation**:
```mermaid
C4Context
    title System Context for {{system_name}}

    Person(user, "End User", "Primary system user")
    Person(admin, "System Admin", "Manages system configuration")

    System(targetSystem, "{{system_name}}", "Core business system")
    System_Ext(authSystem, "Authentication Service", "Handles user authentication")
    System_Ext(paymentSystem, "Payment Gateway", "Processes payments")

    Rel(user, targetSystem, "Uses", "HTTPS")
    Rel(admin, targetSystem, "Configures", "HTTPS")
    Rel(targetSystem, authSystem, "Authenticates users", "OAuth 2.0")
    Rel(targetSystem, paymentSystem, "Processes payments", "REST API")
```

**Best Practices**:
- Keep to 5-10 systems maximum for readability
- Focus on external dependencies and user interactions
- Use descriptive relationship labels
- Include communication protocols where relevant

### Level 2: Container Diagrams
**Purpose**: Show the high-level technology choices and how responsibilities are distributed across containers.

**When to Use**: Required in SAD Section 6.2 (Logical View)

**Elements**:
- **Containers**: Deployable/executable units (web apps, databases, file systems)
- **Technologies**: Programming languages, frameworks, databases
- **Relationships**: How containers communicate

**Mermaid Implementation**:
```mermaid
C4Container
    title Container Diagram for {{system_name}}

    Person(user, "End User")

    System_Boundary(c1, "{{system_name}}") {
        Container(webapp, "Web Application", "React/TypeScript", "Provides user interface")
        Container(api, "API Gateway", "Node.js/Express", "Handles business logic and API routing")
        Container(authService, "Auth Service", "Python/FastAPI", "Manages authentication and authorization")
        Container(database, "Database", "PostgreSQL", "Stores application data")
        Container(cache, "Cache", "Redis", "Caches frequently accessed data")
    }

    System_Ext(authProvider, "OAuth Provider", "External authentication")

    Rel(user, webapp, "Uses", "HTTPS")
    Rel(webapp, api, "API calls", "REST/HTTPS")
    Rel(api, authService, "Validates tokens", "gRPC")
    Rel(api, database, "Read/Write", "SQL/TLS")
    Rel(api, cache, "Cache operations", "Redis Protocol")
    Rel(authService, authProvider, "Authentication", "OAuth 2.0")
```

**Best Practices**:
- Show major containers only (databases, web apps, services)
- Include technology stack information
- Indicate communication protocols
- Group related containers within system boundaries

### Level 3: Component Diagrams
**Purpose**: Show how a container is made up of components, their responsibilities, and technology details.

**When to Use**: Optional in SAD Section 6.2 for complex containers

**Elements**:
- **Components**: Major structural elements within a container
- **Responsibilities**: What each component does
- **Relationships**: How components collaborate

**Mermaid Implementation**:
```mermaid
C4Component
    title Component Diagram for API Gateway Container

    Container(webapp, "Web Application", "React", "User interface")
    Container(database, "Database", "PostgreSQL", "Data storage")

    Container_Boundary(api, "API Gateway") {
        Component(router, "Request Router", "Express Router", "Routes incoming requests")
        Component(auth, "Auth Middleware", "Passport.js", "Handles authentication")
        Component(validator, "Input Validator", "Joi", "Validates request data")
        Component(controller, "Business Controller", "Express Controllers", "Business logic orchestration")
        Component(service, "Data Service", "Sequelize ORM", "Data access layer")
    }

    Rel(webapp, router, "HTTP requests")
    Rel(router, auth, "Authentication check")
    Rel(auth, validator, "Validated requests")
    Rel(validator, controller, "Clean data")
    Rel(controller, service, "Data operations")
    Rel(service, database, "SQL queries")
```

**Best Practices**:
- Focus on significant components only
- Show clear responsibility separation
- Include frameworks and libraries used
- Indicate data flow direction

### Level 4: Code Diagrams
**Purpose**: Show implementation details at the code level.

**When to Use**: Generally not required in SAD documents (implementation detail)

**Note**: SAD documents focus on Levels 1-3 for architectural communication.

## Integration with Epic/Story Development

### Epic Mapping Support
- **Container-to-Epic**: Each major container often maps to an Epic
- **Component-to-Story**: Components within containers map to user stories
- **Integration-to-Story**: Communication patterns become integration stories
- **Deployment-to-Story**: Container deployment becomes infrastructure stories

### Development Team Support
- **Technology Clarity**: Teams understand technology choices from diagrams
- **Integration Understanding**: Communication patterns guide API development
- **Testing Strategy**: Component isolation supports unit testing approach
- **Deployment Planning**: Container view supports DevOps planning

This C4 model guideline ensures consistent, clear visual architecture communication that supports effective SDLC integration and development team understanding.
