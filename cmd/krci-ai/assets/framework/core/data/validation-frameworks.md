## Problem Validation Frameworks

<problem_validation>

### Lean Startup Problem-Solution Fit Assessment

Methodology: Eric Ries Lean Startup approach for validating problem-solution alignment.

Application: Use for Problem Statement and Opportunity sections validation.

Validation Process:

1. Problem Hypothesis Validation
   - Define problem hypothesis with specific user segment
   - Identify measurable problem indicators (support tickets, workarounds, time spent)
   - Validate problem urgency using customer interview evidence
   - Quantify problem frequency and impact

2. Solution Hypothesis Validation
   - Define minimum viable solution approach
   - Test solution desirability with target users
   - Validate solution feasibility with technical constraints
   - Assess solution viability with business model fit

3. Evidence Requirements
   - Customer interview data (minimum 10 target users)
   - Quantified problem metrics (costs, time, frequency)
   - Competitive analysis of existing solutions
   - Technical feasibility assessment

Validation Questions:

- Is this problem urgent enough for users to seek solutions?
- Do users currently pay (time/money) for workarounds?
- Does our solution approach address the root cause?
- Is the solution technically and commercially viable?
