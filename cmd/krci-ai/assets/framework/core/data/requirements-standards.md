# Requirements Standards and Documentation Guidelines

## Requirements Quality Standards

### SMART Requirements Criteria

Framework for ensuring requirements are well-defined and actionable.

- **Specific**: Requirements are clear, unambiguous, and detailed enough for implementation
- **Measurable**: Requirements include quantifiable success criteria and acceptance criteria
- **Achievable**: Requirements are technically and organizationally feasible within constraints
- **Relevant**: Requirements directly support business objectives and stakeholder needs
- **Time-bound**: Requirements include appropriate timing and deadline considerations

### Requirements Characteristics

Essential qualities that all business requirements should possess.

- **Unambiguous**: Requirements have single, clear interpretation without confusion
- **Testable**: Requirements can be verified through testing or validation methods
- **Traceable**: Requirements can be traced to business objectives and solution components
- **Complete**: Requirements include all necessary information for implementation
- **Consistent**: Requirements don't contradict each other or existing system capabilities
- **Feasible**: Requirements can be implemented within technical and resource constraints

## Requirements Documentation Standards

### Functional Requirements Format

Standard structure for documenting functional requirements.

- **Requirement ID**: Unique identifier for traceability
- **Requirement Title**: Brief, descriptive name for the requirement
- **Description**: Detailed explanation of what the system must do
- **Acceptance Criteria**: Specific conditions that must be met for requirement satisfaction
- **Priority**: Business importance level (Critical, High, Medium, Low)
- **Source**: Stakeholder or document that originated the requirement
- **Rationale**: Business justification for the requirement

### Non-Functional Requirements Format

Standard structure for documenting non-functional requirements.

- **Performance Requirements**: Response time, throughput, and capacity specifications
- **Security Requirements**: Authentication, authorization, and data protection needs
- **Usability Requirements**: User experience and accessibility standards
- **Reliability Requirements**: Availability, fault tolerance, and recovery specifications
- **Scalability Requirements**: Growth and expansion capabilities
- **Compliance Requirements**: Regulatory and industry standard adherence

### User Story Format

Agile format for capturing requirements from user perspective.

- **As a** [user role]
- **I want** [functionality or capability]
- **So that** [business value or benefit]
- **Acceptance Criteria**: Specific conditions for story completion
- **Definition of Done**: General completion criteria for all stories

## Requirements Elicitation Standards

### Stakeholder Engagement Guidelines

Best practices for effective stakeholder involvement in requirements gathering.

- **Stakeholder Identification**: Systematically identify all affected parties
- **Stakeholder Analysis**: Understand stakeholder interests, influence, and communication preferences
- **Engagement Planning**: Select appropriate elicitation techniques for each stakeholder group
- **Session Preparation**: Prepare agenda, materials, and logistics for requirements sessions
- **Follow-up Actions**: Document outcomes and distribute findings to participants

### Elicitation Techniques Standards

Guidelines for applying various requirements elicitation methods.

- **Interviews**: One-on-one sessions for detailed requirement exploration
- **Workshops**: Collaborative sessions for group requirement definition
- **Observation**: Direct observation of current processes and user behavior
- **Document Analysis**: Review of existing documentation and system artifacts
- **Surveys**: Structured questionnaires for broad stakeholder input
- **Prototyping**: Visual mockups and prototypes for requirement validation

## Requirements Analysis Standards

### Requirements Prioritization

Systematic approach to ranking requirements based on business value.

- **Business Value Assessment**: Evaluate revenue impact, cost savings, and strategic alignment
- **Implementation Effort**: Estimate development complexity and resource requirements
- **Risk Assessment**: Consider technical risks and implementation challenges
- **Dependency Analysis**: Identify prerequisite requirements and sequencing constraints
- **Stakeholder Input**: Incorporate stakeholder perspectives on requirement importance

### Requirements Validation

Process for ensuring requirements accuracy and completeness.

- **Stakeholder Review**: Formal review sessions with requirement originators
- **Cross-functional Validation**: Review with technical teams for feasibility assessment
- **Business Rules Validation**: Ensure requirements align with business rules and policies
- **Consistency Checking**: Verify requirements don't conflict with each other
- **Gap Analysis**: Identify missing requirements or incomplete areas

## Requirements Management Standards

### Change Control Process

Systematic approach to managing requirements changes throughout the project.

- **Change Request Process**: Formal process for proposing requirement modifications
- **Impact Analysis**: Assessment of change effects on scope, schedule, and budget
- **Approval Process**: Stakeholder review and approval of proposed changes
- **Documentation Updates**: Maintaining current requirement documentation
- **Communication**: Notifying affected parties of approved changes

### Requirements Traceability

Framework for tracking requirements throughout the project lifecycle.

- **Forward Traceability**: Linking requirements to design, code, and test cases
- **Backward Traceability**: Tracing solution components back to originating requirements
- **Bidirectional Traceability**: Maintaining links in both directions for impact analysis
- **Traceability Matrix**: Documenting requirement relationships and dependencies
- **Impact Analysis**: Using traceability for change impact assessment

## Quality Assurance Standards

### Requirements Review Process

Systematic process for reviewing requirement quality and completeness.

- **Peer Review**: Review by other business analysts for quality and consistency
- **Stakeholder Review**: Validation by requirement originators and affected parties
- **Technical Review**: Assessment by technical teams for feasibility and clarity
- **Quality Checklist**: Systematic verification against quality criteria
- **Review Documentation**: Recording review findings and resolution actions

### Requirements Testing

Approach to validating requirements through testing and acceptance criteria.
