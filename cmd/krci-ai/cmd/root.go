for Kubernetes development. It allows you to manage AI agents, tasks, templates,
and data as version-controlled assets.

With KubeRocketAI, you can:
- Install and manage AI framework components
- Work with AI agents for specific development roles
- Use templates for consistent output formatting
- Integrate with popular IDEs and editors

Get started by running 'krci-ai install' to set up your first framework.`,
