## Template Usage Guidelines

### When to Use This Template

- After completing any business framework validation
- When validation results significantly impact project brief confidence
- For stakeholder communication about validation outcomes
- As input for project brief refinement decisions

### Report Types

- **INITIAL**: First validation of a project brief section
- **FOLLOW_UP**: Additional validation to address gaps or concerns
- **COMPREHENSIVE**: Complete validation using multiple frameworks
- **TARGETED**: Focused validation of specific assumptions or evidence gaps

### Quality Scoring

- **1-3**: Poor quality, unreliable for decision making
- **4-6**: Moderate quality, useable with caveats
- **7-8**: Good quality, reliable for most decisions
- **9-10**: Excellent quality, high confidence for all decisions

### Evidence Classification

- **PRIMARY**: Direct research, first-party data, customer feedback
- **SECONDARY**: Industry reports, competitive analysis, expert opinions
- **QUANTIFIED**: Numerical data, measurements, statistical analysis
- **QUALITATIVE**: Descriptive data, observations, subjective assessments
