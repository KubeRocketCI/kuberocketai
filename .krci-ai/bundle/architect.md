# Design Patterns for Architecture

## Architectural Patterns

<architectural_patterns>

### Microservices Pattern

Decompose applications into small, independent services.

- When to use: Large, complex applications with multiple teams
- Benefits: Independent deployment, technology diversity, fault isolation
- Considerations: Network latency, data consistency, operational complexity

### Event-Driven Architecture

Use events to trigger and communicate between decoupled services.

- When to use: Real-time processing, loose coupling requirements
- Benefits: Scalability, flexibility, real-time responsiveness
- Considerations: Event ordering, eventual consistency

### API Gateway Pattern

Centralize cross-cutting concerns for microservices.

- When to use: Multiple client types, microservices architecture
- Benefits: Unified entry point, security, rate limiting
- Considerations: Single point of failure, performance bottleneck

### CQRS (Command Query Responsibility Segregation)

Separate read and write operations for better performance.

- When to use: High-read vs high-write workloads
- Benefits: Optimized read/write models, scalability
- Considerations: Complexity, eventual consistency
</architectural_patterns>

## Integration Patterns

<integration_patterns>

### Circuit Breaker

Prevent cascading failures in distributed systems.

- Implementation: Monitor failure rates, open circuit on threshold
- Benefits: System stability, graceful degradation
- Tools: Hystrix, Resilience4j

### Bulkhead

Isolate resources to prevent total system failure.

- Implementation: Separate thread pools, connection pools
- Benefits: Fault isolation, resource protection

### Retry with Exponential Backoff

Handle transient failures gracefully.

- Implementation: Exponential delays between retries
- Benefits: Improved reliability, reduced system load
</integration_patterns>

## Data Patterns

<data_patterns>

### Database per Service

Each microservice owns its data exclusively.

- Benefits: Service independence, technology flexibility
- Considerations: Data consistency, query complexity

### Saga Pattern

Manage distributed transactions across services.

- Types: Choreography-based, Orchestration-based
- Benefits: Data consistency without distributed transactions

### Event Sourcing

Store events instead of current state.

- Benefits: Complete audit trail, temporal queries
- Considerations: Storage overhead, complexity
</data_patterns>

## Security Patterns

<security_patterns>

### Zero Trust Architecture

Never trust, always verify approach to security.

- Principles: Verify identity, least privilege, assume breach
- Implementation: Multi-factor authentication, micro-segmentation

### OAuth 2.0 / OpenID Connect

Standard patterns for authentication and authorization.

- Use cases: API access, single sign-on, third-party integration
</security_patterns>

## Performance Patterns

<performance_patterns>

### Caching Strategies

- Cache-Aside: Application manages cache
- Write-Through: Write to cache and database simultaneously
- Write-Behind: Write to cache first, database later

### Load Balancing

- Round Robin: Distribute requests evenly
- Least Connections: Route to server with fewest active connections
- Weighted: Route based on server capacity
</performance_patterns>

<common_issues>

| Issue | Resolution | Agent Action |
|-------|------------|--------------|
| Epic creation blocked | PRD incomplete | Return to Product Manager for PRD completion |
| Story blocked by Architecture | Architecture not defined | Complete Architecture Document before Story creation |
| Implementation blocked | Story criteria unclear | Return to Product Owner for Story refinement |
| Testing blocked | Code incomplete | Ensure Developer completes all Story requirements |
| Template variables unfilled | Validation failed | Complete all `{{variables}}` using referenced templates |
| Framework component errors | Validation failed | Consult Framework Advisor for component creation/fixes |

</common_issues>

<agent_workflow>

1. Find role in `<roles>` table (ID, outputs, dependencies)
2. Check dependencies exist and approved
3. Load templates: `.krci-ai/templates/{artifact-template}.md`
4. Execute task: `.krci-ai/tasks/{task-name}.md`
5. Validate: No `{{variables}}` unfilled, dependencies referenced
6. Quality gate: Standards met before handoff

Path examples: `.krci-ai/templates/story.md`
</agent_workflow>

## Template Variables

Templates use `{{variable_name}}` format. Required fields must be populated.
Example: `{{epic_title}}` ‚Üí "User Authentication System"

### Template Conventions

CRITICAL: XML tags in templates are agent guidance only - exclude from final output.
