Epic Reference Example: "Epic 1 - KubeRocketAI Baseline"
Priority Example: Critical, High, Medium, Low
Story Points Example: 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13 (Fibonacci scale - estimate complexity)
Jira Example: "[EPMDEDP-15497]"
-->

## Dependencies

**Story Dependencies:**
{{dependencies}}

<!-- Define what this story depends on and what depends on it -->
<!-- Critical for LLM execution order and validation -->

<!-- Template Guidance:
Dependencies Example:
- "Story 01.01: Architect Agent Definition (foundation patterns)"
- "System: Python validation tooling infrastructure"
- "None" if independent story

Format: Use "Story XX.YY: Brief description" or "System: Description"
✅ DO: List specific story numbers and brief context
✅ DO: Include external system dependencies
❌ DON'T: List vague dependencies like "architecture work"
-->

## Story

**As a** {{persona}},
**I want** {{goal}},
**so that** {{business_value}}.

<!-- Standard user story format focusing on persona, goal, and business value -->
<!-- Must align with Epic's target users and provide specific value -->

<!-- Template Guidance:
Story Example:
"As a Software Architect,
I want a complete architect agent framework with system design capabilities,
so that I can immediately use KubeRocketAI for comprehensive architectural analysis."

Persona Example: Use specific persona from Epic (e.g., "Software Architect", "Development Lead", "QA Engineer")
Goal Example: Specific, measurable capability the user wants
Business Value Example: Clear outcome or benefit that explains the "why"

✅ DO: Use persona from Epic's target users
✅ DO: Make goal specific and measurable
✅ DO: Explain clear business value
❌ DON'T: Use generic roles like "user" or "developer"
❌ DON'T: Make goals vague like "improve experience"
-->

## Acceptance Criteria

{{acceptance_criteria}}

<!-- Specific, testable conditions that define completion -->
<!-- Must include file deliverables and verification commands for LLM validation -->

<!-- Template Guidance:
Acceptance Criteria Example:
1. File `assets/agents/architect.yaml` exists and passes schema validation
2. Agent responds to queries within 5 seconds in IDE testing
3. Validation command `python hack/validate-agents.py` returns exit code 0
4. Agent generates output following template format with required variables

Format Structure:
- Use numbered list for clear tracking
- Include specific file paths and expected outputs
- Add verification commands LLMs can execute
- Define measurable success criteria

✅ DO: Include file deliverables with exact paths
✅ DO: Add verification commands and expected results
✅ DO: Make criteria testable and measurable
✅ DO: Reference Epic's BR/NFR requirements where applicable
❌ DON'T: Use subjective criteria like "works well"
❌ DON'T: Omit verification steps for LLM validation
-->

## Description

{{description}}

<!-- Context explaining why this story exists and its strategic importance -->
<!-- Should provide background for LLM understanding and Epic alignment -->

<!-- Template Guidance:
Description Example:
"This foundational story establishes the architect agent framework as the first complete implementation of the KubeRocketAI four-asset-type model. The architect agent serves as the pattern-setter for subsequent agent development, demonstrating progressive complexity from Level 1 through Level 4."

Content Focus:
- WHY this story exists within the Epic
- Strategic importance and business context
- Relationships to other stories and architectural decisions
- Implementation philosophy or approach rationale

✅ DO: Explain the strategic importance within Epic context
✅ DO: Include relationships to other stories
✅ DO: Provide context for implementation decisions
❌ DON'T: Repeat acceptance criteria or implementation details
❌ DON'T: Include generic descriptions
-->

## Tasks/Subtasks

{{tasks_subtasks}}

<!-- LLM-executable implementation plan with atomic tasks and validation -->
<!-- Each task maps to acceptance criteria with specific commands and file paths -->

<!-- Template Guidance:
Tasks/Subtasks Structure Example:

- [ ] Task 1: Create Agent Foundation (AC: 1, 2, 3)
  - [ ] Create file: `assets/agents/architect.yaml` with identity structure
  - [ ] Validate schema: `python hack/validate-agents.py`
  - [ ] Test IDE integration: Confirm @agent functionality in Cursor
- [ ] Task 2: Implementation Validation (AC: 4)
  - [ ] Run verification: `grep -q "expected_pattern" output.md`
  - [ ] Document results: Update Implementation Results section

Task Structure Guidelines:
- Reference acceptance criteria: (AC: X, Y, Z)
- Atomic subtasks: One action per checkbox
- Specific commands: Include exact file paths and commands
- Validation steps: Add verification for each deliverable
- Dependencies: Note task order requirements

✅ DO: Structure as main Tasks with atomic Subtasks
✅ DO: Include specific file paths and commands
✅ DO: Add validation steps for each deliverable
✅ DO: Reference acceptance criteria numbers
✅ DO: Use checkbox format for progress tracking
❌ DON'T: Create tasks that require human interpretation
❌ DON'T: Omit validation or verification steps
❌ DON'T: Use vague action words like "handle" or "manage"

Command Patterns for LLMs:
- File creation: `create file: path/to/file.ext`
- File editing: `edit file: path/to/file.ext`
- Command execution: `run: command with args`
- Validation: `verify: validation_command`
-->

## Implementation Results

{{implementation_results}}

<!-- Concrete outcomes and deliverables populated AFTER story completion -->
<!-- Documents actual files created, commands executed, and validation results -->

<!-- Template Guidance:
Implementation Results Example:

### Completed Deliverables
**Agent Infrastructure:**
- ✅ `architect.yaml` agent implemented with identity structure
- ✅ Schema validation passing: `python hack/validate-agents.py`
- ✅ IDE integration tested: Cursor @agent functionality confirmed

**Validation Results:**
- ✅ All acceptance criteria verified and passing
- ✅ Files created at expected locations
- ✅ Commands executed successfully with expected outputs

Content Guidelines:
- Use past tense: "Created", "Implemented", "Validated"
- Include actual file paths and command results
- Document validation outcomes
- Group by logical categories

✅ DO: Populate AFTER completion with concrete outcomes
✅ DO: Include actual file paths and verification results
✅ DO: Use past tense for completed actions
✅ DO: Group results by logical categories
❌ DON'T: Populate before implementation
❌ DON'T: Use future tense or planning language
-->

## QA Checklist

{{qa_checklist}}

<!-- Specific verification steps with commands and expected outputs -->
<!-- Enables automated testing and quality validation -->

<!-- Template Guidance:
QA Checklist Example:

### Functional Testing
- [ ] **Schema Validation**: Run `python hack/validate-agents.py` - Expected: exit code 0
- [ ] **File Existence**: Verify `ls -la assets/agents/architect.yaml` - Expected: file exists
- [ ] **Content Validation**: Check `grep -q "identity" architect.yaml` - Expected: pattern found

### Integration Testing
- [ ] **IDE Testing**: Test agent in Cursor @agent - Expected: responds within 5 seconds
- [ ] **Cross-platform**: Validate on macOS, Linux, Windows - Expected: consistent behavior

Format Structure:
- Group by testing type (Functional, Integration, Performance)
- Include specific commands with expected outputs
- Add verification steps and success indicators
- Enable automated validation where possible

✅ DO: Include specific verification commands with expected outputs
✅ DO: Group by testing categories
✅ DO: Add measurable success criteria

# Product Prioritization Frameworks

## Primary Prioritization Methods

### 1. RICE Framework

Reach, Impact, Confidence, Effort prioritization method.

- **Reach**: How many users will be affected in a given period?
- **Impact**: How much will this increase the key metric per user?
- **Confidence**: How confident are you in your estimates?
- **Effort**: How much time and resources will this require?
- **Score**: (Reach × Impact × Confidence) / Effort

### 2. MoSCoW Method

Must have, Should have, Could have, Won't have prioritization.

- **Must Have**: Critical requirements that must be implemented
- **Should Have**: Important features that add significant value
- **Could Have**: Nice-to-have features that enhance the product
- **Won't Have**: Features that are out of scope for this release

### 3. Value vs Effort Matrix

Two-dimensional prioritization based on value and implementation effort.

- **Quick Wins**: High value, low effort (prioritize first)
- **Big Bets**: High value, high effort (strategic investments)
- **Fill-ins**: Low value, low effort (when capacity allows)
- **Time Wasters**: Low value, high effort (avoid or deprioritize)

### 4. Kano Model

User satisfaction vs feature implementation prioritization.

- **Must-be Features**: Basic expectations that cause dissatisfaction if missing
- **Performance Features**: Features that increase satisfaction linearly
- **Attractive Features**: Delighters that provide competitive advantage
- **Indifferent Features**: Features that don't significantly impact satisfaction

## Advanced Prioritization Techniques

# SDLC Framework Quick Reference

**Purpose**: This framework enables AI agents to collaborate in software development through structured, filesystem-based artifacts. Agents reference this document to understand their role, dependencies, and where to find required templates and standards.

## Framework Principles

- **Filesystem-First**: All artifacts stored as markdown files, no APIs
- **Agent Discovery**: Agents find artifacts through organized directory structure
- **Natural Language**: Human-readable artifacts that agents can process
- **Clear Dependencies**: Each artifact builds on previous work
- **Inline References**: Use `[filename](path/to/file)` markdown links for all references

## Role Responsibilities

| Role | Outputs | Dependencies |
|------|---------|--------------|
| **Product Manager** | Project Brief, PRD, Roadmap | None (root artifacts) |
| **Product Owner** | Epics, Stories | PRD |
| **Business Analyst** | Refined PRD, Workflows | PRD, Stakeholder inputs |
| **Architect** | Architecture Documents | PRD, Epics |
| **Developer** | Code, Implementation | Stories, Architecture |
| **QA Engineer** | Test Results, Quality Reports | Stories, Code |

## Artifact Flow

```text
Project Brief → PRD → Epics → Stories → Code → Tests → MVP
                  ↓
              Architecture ← → Code
```

**Dependency Rules:**

- **Project Brief**: No dependencies (root artifact)
- **PRD**: Requires Project Brief approval
- **Epic**: Requires PRD completion, references specific BR/NFR requirements
- **Story**: Requires Epic definition, maps to implementation tasks
- **Architecture**: Requires PRD + Epic context for technical design
- **Code**: Requires Stories + Architecture for implementation guidance
- **Tests**: Requires Stories + Code for validation

    └── data/                       # REFERENCE: Standards & guidelines
```

## Quality Gates

1. **Project Brief Approval** → Enables PRD creation
2. **PRD Approval** → Enables Epic/Architecture creation
3. **Architecture Review** → Enables implementation
4. **Code Review** → Enables testing
5. **Test Validation** → Enables MVP delivery

## Template Variables

All templates use `{{variable_name}}` format for dynamic content:

- **Required fields**: Must be populated, no empty `{{}}` allowed
- **Dependencies**: Reference parent artifacts (Epic references PRD requirements)
- **Traceability**: Link requirements to implementation (BR1, NFR2, etc.)

## Success Flow

**Idea** → **PM (Brief+PRD)** → **PO (Epics+Stories)** → **Architect (Design)** → **Developer (Code)** → **QA (Tests)** → **MVP**

## Framework Implementation

**Agent Structure**: Each role has dedicated agent with commands mapping to tasks
**Task Structure**: Procedural workflows with inline template/data references
**Template Structure**: Markdown files with `{{variables}}` for dynamic content
**Data Structure**: Standards, principles, and technical specifications
