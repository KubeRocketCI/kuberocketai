## Dependencies

**Blocking:**
{{blocking_dependencies}}

**Blocked By:**
{{blocked_by_dependencies}}

**System/Test Dependencies:**
{{system_test_dependencies}}

<!-- Define precise dependencies for execution order and validation readiness -->

<!-- Template Guidance:
Format:
- Blocking: Items that depend on this story
- Blocked By: Items this story depends on (stories, approvals)
- System/Test: Environments, versions, stubs/mocks, fixtures

Examples:
- Blocking: Story 02.03 (depends on config file produced here)
- Blocked By: Story 02.01 (API contract), Security approval
- System/Test: Local IDP stub v1.2; Env var FEATURE_FLAG=on

DO:
- Use exact story numbers/links and system versions
- Include test doubles (stubs/mocks) to avoid external blockers
- State "None" explicitly if empty

DON'T:
- List vague dependencies (e.g., "backend work")
- Omit versions/links where relevant
- Depend on production-only services for acceptance
-->

## Story

**I want** {{goal}},
**so that** {{business_value}}.

<!-- Standard story format focusing on persona, goal, and value -->
<!-- Must align with Epic Target Users and provide specific value -->

<!-- Template Guidance:
Story Example:
"As a Software Engineer,
I want a unified agent activation command in the IDE,
so that I can start using an agent without extra setup."

DO:
- Use persona from Epic (PRD-defined), not generic labels
- Make the goal specific and implementation-agnostic
- State tangible business/user value

DON'T:
- Invent personas not defined in PRD/Epic
- Use vague goals like "improve experience"
- Include solution details here
-->

## Acceptance Criteria

{{acceptance_criteria}}

<!-- Specific, testable conditions that define completion at story level -->
<!-- Story ACs SHOULD include verification commands and expected outputs -->

<!-- Required Structure for each criterion:
1. Scenario (Given/When/Then): Brief user/system flow to validate
2. Expected Behavior: Clear, observable outcome
3. Verification Command: Non-interactive command(s) with expected exit code/output
4. Files Created/Changed: Exact paths
5. Guardrails: NFR constraints applicable to this story (e.g., perf, security)
6. Test Data/Fixtures: Test users, payloads, seeds
7. Environment/Flags: Env vars, feature flags/toggles, mock/stub switches
8. Evidence: Required artifacts (logs, screenshots, run output)
9. Non-automatable at story-level: true/false (and rationale if true)
10. Traceability: Epic AC id(s), PRD BR/NFR
11. Out of Scope (optional): Clarify non-goals
-->

<!-- Template Guidance:
Acceptance Criteria Example:
"1. Unified activation command works in Cursor
   - Scenario: Given a valid agent config, when the user runs the activation command in Cursor, then the agent is activated
   - Expected Behavior: IDE shows active agent; no extra prompts
   - Verification Method: automated; run `python tools/activate_agent.py --ide=cursor --agent=architect` (Expect: exit 0, "Activated" in stdout)
   - Evidence: Command output artifact attached
   - Non-automatable at story-level: false
   - Files Created/Changed: `.ide/agents/architect.state`
   - Guardrails: Command completes in <= 3s on staging; no P0/P1 errors
   - Test Data/Fixtures: `fixtures/agents/architect.yaml`
   - Environment/Flags: `FEATURE_UNIFIED_ACTIVATION=1`
   - Traceability: Epic AC #1; BR2, BR3

2. Session continuity during workday
   - Scenario: Given a valid SSO session, when the user switches from Tool A to Tool B, then no re-auth is required within policy window
   - Expected Behavior: Continuous access without credential prompts
   - Verification Method: manual; steps 1‚Äì4 in staging with local IDP stub; observe uninterrupted access and audit log entry
   - Evidence: Screen recording + audit log excerpt
   - Non-automatable at story-level: true (follow-up: automate via Playwright against stub)
   - Files Created/Changed: None
   - Guardrails: Logout invalidates sessions in <= 60s
   - Test Data/Fixtures: Test user `sso_user@test`, seeded session
   - Environment/Flags: `SESSION_TTL_MINUTES=480`; local IDP stub enabled
   - Traceability: Epic AC #2; BR5, NFR-SEC

3. Failure handling
   - Scenario: Given the dependency is unavailable, when activation is attempted, then a clear, actionable error is shown and retry succeeds after recovery
   - Expected Behavior: Friendly error; subsequent retry succeeds
   - Verification Method: semi-automated; curl request to stubbed endpoint (Expect: HTTP 503 with error JSON), then after recovery (Expect: HTTP 200)
   - Evidence: Captured curl responses + log lines
   - Non-automatable at story-level: false
   - Files Created/Changed: `logs/activation.log`
   - Guardrails: No corrupted state; no secrets in logs
   - Test Data/Fixtures: Outage flag in stub config
   - Environment/Flags: `ACTIVATION_RETRY=1`
   - Traceability: Epic AC #3; NFR-UX1, NFR-REL"

Edge cases to cover (example list):
- Invalid agent name
- Missing permissions
- Network interruption mid-activation

# Design Patterns for Architecture

## Architectural Patterns

### Microservices Pattern

Decompose applications into small, independent services.

- **When to use**: Large, complex applications with multiple teams
- **Benefits**: Independent deployment, technology diversity, fault isolation
- **Considerations**: Network latency, data consistency, operational complexity

### Event-Driven Architecture

Use events to trigger and communicate between decoupled services.

- **When to use**: Real-time processing, loose coupling requirements
- **Benefits**: Scalability, flexibility, real-time responsiveness
- **Considerations**: Event ordering, eventual consistency

### API Gateway Pattern

Centralize cross-cutting concerns for microservices.

- **When to use**: Multiple client types, microservices architecture
- **Benefits**: Unified entry point, security, rate limiting
- **Considerations**: Single point of failure, performance bottleneck

### CQRS (Command Query Responsibility Segregation)

Separate read and write operations for better performance.

- **When to use**: High-read vs high-write workloads
- **Benefits**: Optimized read/write models, scalability
- **Considerations**: Complexity, eventual consistency

## Integration Patterns

### Circuit Breaker

Prevent cascading failures in distributed systems.

- **Implementation**: Monitor failure rates, open circuit on threshold
- **Benefits**: System stability, graceful degradation
- **Tools**: Hystrix, Resilience4j

### Bulkhead

Isolate resources to prevent total system failure.

- **Implementation**: Separate thread pools, connection pools
- **Benefits**: Fault isolation, resource protection

### Retry with Exponential Backoff

Handle transient failures gracefully.

- **Implementation**: Exponential delays between retries
- **Benefits**: Improved reliability, reduced system load

## Data Patterns

### Database per Service

Each microservice owns its data exclusively.

- **Benefits**: Service independence, technology flexibility
- **Considerations**: Data consistency, query complexity

### Saga Pattern

Manage distributed transactions across services.

- **Types**: Choreography-based, Orchestration-based
- **Benefits**: Data consistency without distributed transactions

### Event Sourcing

Store events instead of current state.

- **Benefits**: Complete audit trail, temporal queries
- **Considerations**: Storage overhead, complexity

## Security Patterns

### Zero Trust Architecture

Never trust, always verify approach to security.

- **Principles**: Verify identity, least privilege, assume breach
- **Implementation**: Multi-factor authentication, micro-segmentation

### OAuth 2.0 / OpenID Connect

Standard patterns for authentication and authorization.

- **Use cases**: API access, single sign-on, third-party integration

## Performance Patterns

### Caching Strategies

- **Cache-Aside**: Application manages cache
- **Write-Through**: Write to cache and database simultaneously
- **Write-Behind**: Write to cache first, database later

### Load Balancing

- **Round Robin**: Distribute requests evenly
- **Least Connections**: Route to server with fewest active connections
- **Weighted**: Route based on server capacity
