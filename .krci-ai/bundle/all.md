# Task: Implement a new Kubernetes Custom Resource

## Description

This guide provides a comprehensive prompt for LLM to implement a new Kubernetes Custom Resource.

## Instructions

<instructions>
BEFORE ANY IMPLEMENTATION confirm you have read and fully understand [Operator Best Practices](./.krci-ai/data/operator-best-practices.md) to apply ALL Kubernetes operator-specific patterns, architectural principles, CRD design guidelines, and operational practices. Ensure dependencies declared in the YAML frontmatter are readable before proceeding.

CRITICAL FIRST STEP: You MUST run the `make operator-sdk create api` command first to scaffold the proper structure before manually creating any files. See Step 1.0 in the Implementation Steps below for detailed instructions.

You are tasked with implementing a new Kubernetes Custom Resource for the `your-operator` project following the chain of responsibility pattern for handling reconciliation logic. Follow the [Operator SDK Tutorial](https://sdk.operatorframework.io/docs/building-operators/golang/tutorial/) as the foundation for implementing your controller.
 </instructions>

### 1 Scaffold API and Controller

<scaffold_api_controller>
Before implementing the controller, ask the user for the CustomResource details:

1. Group: The API group (typically use `v1` for this project)
2. Version: The API version (typically `v1alpha1`)
3. Kind: The CustomResource kind name (e.g., `KeycloakClient`, `KeycloakUser`, etc.)

Once you have these details, use the Operator SDK to scaffold the basic API and controller structure:

```bash
make operator-sdk create api --group <group> --version <version> --kind <kind> --resource --controller
```

Example: If the user wants to create a `KeycloakClient` CustomResource:

```bash
make operator-sdk create api --group v1 --version v1alpha1 --kind KeycloakClient --resource --controller
```

This command will create:

- API types in `api/v1alpha1/`
- Controller skeleton in `internal/controller/`
- Basic RBAC markers

After scaffolding, you'll need to customize the generated code to follow the project's specific patterns described in the sections below.
</scaffold_api_controller>

### 2 Implement the API Types

<implement_api_types>
Implement your Custom Resource Definition (CRD) spec and status, based on user requirements, in `api/v1alpha1/`:

Note: The following examples use `YourResource` as a placeholder. Replace this with the actual resource name you specified during scaffolding.

```go
// +kubebuilder:object:root=true
// +kubebuilder:subresource:status

// YourResource is the Schema for the yourresources API
type YourResource struct {
    metav1.TypeMeta   `json:",inline"`
    metav1.ObjectMeta `json:"metadata,omitempty"`

    Spec   YourResourceSpec   `json:"spec,omitempty"`
    Status YourResourceStatus `json:"status,omitempty"`
}

// YourResourceSpec defines the desired state of YourResource
type YourResourceSpec struct {
    // Add your spec fields here
}

// YourResourceStatus defines the observed state of YourResource
type YourResourceStatus struct {
    // Add your status fields here
}
```

</implement_api_types>

### 3 Generate Code and Manifests

<generate_code_manifests>
Run the following commands to generate the necessary code:

```bash
make generate
make manifests
```

</generate_code_manifests>

### 4 Implement the Controller

<implement_controller>
Implement your controller in `internal/controller/yourresource/` following the existing pattern:

Note: Replace `YourResource` and `yourresource` with the actual resource name you specified during scaffolding.

```go
package yourresource

import (
    "context"
    "fmt"
    "time"

    "k8s.io/apimachinery/pkg/api/equality"
    k8sErrors "k8s.io/apimachinery/pkg/api/errors"
    ctrl "sigs.k8s.io/controller-runtime"
    "sigs.k8s.io/controller-runtime/pkg/client"
    "sigs.k8s.io/controller-runtime/pkg/controller/controllerutil"
    "sigs.k8s.io/controller-runtime/pkg/reconcile"

    yourresourceApi "github.com/your-org/your-operator/api/v1" // Replace with your actual module path
)

const (
    defaultRequeueTime = time.Second * 30
    successRequeueTime = time.Minute * 10
    finalizerName      = "yourresource.operator.finalizer.name"
)

// NewReconcileYourResource creates a new ReconcileYourResource with all necessary dependencies.
func NewReconcileYourResource(
    client client.Client,
) *ReconcileYourResource {
    return &ReconcileYourResource{
        client:            client,
    }
}

type ReconcileYourResource struct {
    client client.Client
}

func (r *ReconcileYourResource) SetupWithManager(mgr ctrl.Manager) error {
    return ctrl.NewControllerManagedBy(mgr).
        For(&yourresourceApi.YourResource{}).
        Complete(r)
}

// +kubebuilder:rbac:groups=yourgroup,namespace=placeholder,resources=yourresources,verbs=get;list;watch;create;update;patch;delete
// +kubebuilder:rbac:groups=yourgroup,namespace=placeholder,resources=yourresources/status,verbs=get;update;patch
// +kubebuilder:rbac:groups=yourgroup,namespace=placeholder,resources=yourresources/finalizers,verbs=update
// +kubebuilder:rbac:groups="",namespace=placeholder,resources=secrets,verbs=get;list;watch

func (r *ReconcileYourResource) Reconcile(ctx context.Context, request reconcile.Request) (reconcile.Result, error) {
    log := ctrl.LoggerFrom(ctx)
    log.Info("Reconciling YourResource")

    yourResource := &yourresourceApi.YourResource{}
    if err := r.client.Get(ctx, request.NamespacedName, yourResource); err != nil {
        if k8sErrors.IsNotFound(err) {
            return reconcile.Result{}, nil
        }
        return reconcile.Result{}, err
    }


    if yourResource.GetDeletionTimestamp() != nil {
        if controllerutil.ContainsFinalizer(yourResource, finalizerName) {
            if err = chain.NewRemoveResource().ServeRequest(ctx, yourResource); err != nil {
                return ctrl.Result{}, err
            }

            controllerutil.RemoveFinalizer(yourResource, finalizerName)

            if err = r.client.Update(ctx, yourResource); err != nil {
                return ctrl.Result{}, err
            }
        }

        return ctrl.Result{}, nil
    }

    if controllerutil.AddFinalizer(yourResource, finalizerName) {
        err = r.client.Update(ctx, yourResource)
        if err != nil {
            return ctrl.Result{}, err
        }

  // Get yourResource again to get the updated object
  if err = r.client.Get(ctx, request.NamespacedName, yourResource); err != nil {
   return reconcile.Result{}, err
  }
    }

    oldStatus := yourResource.Status.DeepCopy()

    if err = chain.MakeChain(r.client).ServeRequest(ctx, yourResource); err != nil {
        log.Error(err, "An error has occurred while handling YourResource")

        yourResource.Status.SetError(err.Error())

        if statusErr := r.updateYourResourceStatus(ctx, yourResource, oldStatus); statusErr != nil {
            return reconcile.Result{}, statusErr
        }

        return reconcile.Result{}, err
    }

    yourResource.Status.SetOK()

    if err = r.updateYourResourceStatus(ctx, yourResource, oldStatus); err != nil {
        return reconcile.Result{}, err
    }

    log.Info("Reconciling YourResource is finished")

    return reconcile.Result{
        RequeueAfter: successRequeueTime,
    }, nil
}

func (r *ReconcileYourResource) updateYourResourceStatus(
 ctx context.Context,
 yourResource *yourresourceApi.YourResource,
 oldStatus yourresourceApi.YourResourceStatus,
) error {
    if equality.Semantic.DeepEqual(&yourResource.Status, oldStatus) {
        return nil
    }

    if err := r.client.Status().Update(ctx, yourResource); err != nil {
        return fmt.Errorf("failed to update YourResource status: %w", err)
    }

    return nil
}
```

</implement_controller>

### 5 Implement the Chain of Responsibility

<implement_chain>
Create a chain package in `internal/controller/yourresource/chain/` with the following structure:

1. `chain.go` - Main chain implementation
2. `factory.go` - Chain factory
3. Individual handler files for each step in the chain

Note: Replace `yourresource` and `YourResource` with the actual resource name you specified during scaffolding.

Example `chain.go`:

```go
package chain

import (
    "context"
    "sigs.k8s.io/controller-runtime/pkg/client"

    yourApi "github.com/your-org/your-operator/api/v1"
)

type Chain interface {
    ServeRequest(ctx context.Context, yourResource *yourApi.YourResource) error
}

type chain struct {
    handlers []Handler
}

func (c *chain) ServeRequest(ctx context.Context, yourResource *yourApi.YourResource) error {
    for _, handler := range c.handlers {
        if err := handler.ServeRequest(ctx, yourResource); err != nil {
            return err
        }
    }
    return nil
}

type Handler interface {
    ServeRequest(ctx context.Context, yourResource *yourApi.YourResource) error
}

func MakeChain(k8sClient client.Client) Chain {
    return &chain{
        handlers: []Handler{
            // Add your handlers here
        },
    }
}
```

Example handler implementations should follow the pattern of existing handlers in your chain.
</implement_chain>

### 6 Register the Controller

<register_controller>
Add your controller to `cmd/main.go`:

```go
import (
    yourresourcecontroller "github.com/your-org/your-operator/controllers/yourresource"
)

// In the main function, add:
if err = yourresourcecontroller.NewReconcileYourResource(mgr.GetClient()).SetupWithManager(mgr); err != nil {
    setupLog.Error(err, "unable to create controller", "controller", "YourResource")
    os.Exit(1)
}
```

Note: Replace `YourResource` with the actual resource name you specified during scaffolding.
</register_controller>

# Task: Create GitLab CI/CD Component Library

## Description

Scaffold production-ready GitLab CI/CD component library with standardized stage flow and critical dependencies for any tech stack. Component libraries provide reusable job templates, separate review/build workflows, and consistent architectural patterns while allowing technology-specific job implementations.

<instructions>
Gather tech stack requirements. Ask for programming language, framework, build tool, test framework, container image, and typical build/test commands. Identify code quality tools (linters, formatters, SonarQube). Determine deployment artifacts and Helm chart requirements if applicable.

Create repository structure with standardized stage flow. Initialize Git repository with templates/ directory. Create common.yml for shared job templates with MANDATORY 7-stage structure: [prepare, test, build, verify, package, publish, release]. Create review.yml for merge request pipeline, build.yml for main branch pipeline. Add README.md, LICENSE.md, .gitlab-ci.yml, and .gitignore. Include sample source code for testing components.

Define shared job templates in common.yml with critical dependencies. Create separated .test-job and .build-job templates (never combined). Create mandatory init-values job in prepare stage producing dotenv artifacts. Implement technology-specific caching patterns. Define spec:inputs for stage names, container image, and tech-stack-specific parameters. Use $[[ inputs.name ]] interpolation throughout.

Implement review pipeline in review.yml following test→build→verify flow. Include common.yml with local include pattern. Add MANDATORY jobs: init-values (prepare), test (test stage), build (build stage, depends on test), sonar (build stage, depends on init-values + test). Add technology-specific jobs as needed within appropriate stages. Configure Docker build verification without publishing in verify stage.

Implement build pipeline in build.yml following test→build→package→publish flow. Include common.yml and extend shared templates. Add MANDATORY dependency patterns: build depends on test completion, sonar depends on init-values + test artifacts, buildkit-build depends on init-values + build artifacts, git-tag depends on init-values artifacts. Add technology-specific packaging jobs as needed.

Create orchestration in main .gitlab-ci.yml with standardized stages. Define workflow rules for merge requests and protected branches. Include review component conditionally for merge requests. Include build component conditionally for main branch. Pass global variables as component inputs. Define MANDATORY stage sequence: [prepare, test, build, verify, package, publish, release].

Document component library in README.md. Explain library purpose, standardized stage flow, and available components. Create inputs table documenting all parameters with defaults. Provide usage examples for including components. List required CI/CD variables. Document mandatory vs technology-specific jobs and their stage placement.

Test components locally with critical dependency validation. Run pipeline with components referencing $CI_COMMIT_SHA. Verify init-values produces dotenv artifacts, test produces coverage, build depends on test, sonar consumes both init-values and test artifacts. Validate all inputs work with various values. Confirm artifact flow and dependencies function correctly.

Publish component library. Enable CI/CD Catalog project setting in repository. Create semantic version tag. Add release job using release-cli image. Test component consumption from catalog. Document versioning, stage flow requirements, and upgrade guidance.
</instructions>

## Framework Context

Standardized Stage Flow: ALL component libraries MUST follow the 7-stage architecture: [prepare, test, build, verify, package, publish, release]. This ensures consistent user experience across all technology stacks while allowing technology-specific job implementations within each stage.

Critical Dependencies: MANDATORY dependency patterns ensure proper artifact flow: init-values produces dotenv artifacts, test produces coverage artifacts, build depends on test completion, sonar depends on init-values + test artifacts, packaging jobs depend on build artifacts. These patterns are technology-agnostic and must be implemented consistently.

Component Library Pattern: GitLab CI/CD component libraries organize related components (common, review, build) into cohesive units. Common templates define reusable job patterns with separated .test-job and .build-job templates, while review and build components extend these for specific workflow contexts. GitLab supports up to 100 components per project.

Spec Inputs: Components declare inputs in spec section with defaults and descriptions. Inputs use `$[[ inputs.name ]]` interpolation syntax. Always provide defaults for usability. Document every input in README with type, default value, and description.

Component Composition: Use local includes to compose components. Review and build components typically include common.yml to extend shared job templates. This promotes DRY principles and consistency across workflows.

Workflow Separation: Review pipelines validate merge requests with test→build→verify flow without publishing. Build pipelines execute on main branch with test→build→package→publish flow. Use workflow rules and component-level rules for conditional execution. GitLab supports multiple pipeline types (branch, tag, merge request) that can run simultaneously - workflow rules prevent duplicate pipeline execution.

Testing Requirements: Component repositories must include sample source code for testing. Components are tested locally using `$CI_COMMIT_SHA` reference before publication. Validate all inputs work correctly with various configurations.

Security Requirements: Component projects must implement security best practices. Use protected branches for releases with merge request approvals. Enable 2FA for all maintainers. Sign commits for integrity verification. Store secrets securely using protected CI/CD variables which are only accessible to protected branch and tag pipelines, preventing credential exposure in fork merge requests. Use minimally scoped tokens. Audit component code before consumption. Pin component versions to specific commits or tags when consuming components.

# Task: Core Create Task

## Description

Guide user through creating framework-compliant tasks following KubeRocketAI patterns. This task provides step-by-step instructions for creating tasks that use XML guidance tags, frontmatter dependencies, and proper structure for LLM processing within the AI-as-Code framework.

<instructions>
Define task specification. Ask user for exact task name, target agent, and task purpose. Clarify what the task will accomplish and which agent will reference it (example: task core-analyze-metrics.md for advisor agent).

Review framework standards for task creation. Read task structure requirements from core-framework-standards.yaml. Understand required sections, XML guidance system, dependency frontmatter format, and validation requirements.

Apply XML guidance system. Use instructions and success_criteria XML tags for LLM section identification and processing guidance. Structure instructions as natural paragraph flow with imperative verbs and inline HALT conditions. Define success_criteria with specific, measurable validation criteria.

Follow naming conventions. Use descriptive task names with appropriate prefixes. Apply core- prefix for framework tasks. Use kebab-case for file naming. Ensure name clearly indicates task purpose and scope.

Manage dependencies in frontmatter. Create YAML frontmatter at file beginning. List all referenced data files under dependencies.data section. List all referenced templates under dependencies.templates section. Verify all dependency paths resolve to existing files.

Structure task following template pattern. Use core-task-template.md as structural guide. Include required sections: Title, Description, Instructions (XML), Framework Context, Output Format, Success Criteria (XML), Execution Checklist. Follow logical section progression for clear task flow.

Ensure self-contained guidance. Include explanations of framework patterns and validation requirements. Provide context for XML tag system purpose and usage. Add educational content about architectural concepts relevant to task. Enable context-free usage without requiring external knowledge.

Format output for framework compliance. Save to ./.krci-ai/tasks/{task-name}.md following path conventions. Populate all template variables with task-specific content. Ensure instructions use natural paragraph flow without numbered lists. Verify all framework references use correct inline format.

Run framework validation. Execute krci-ai validate and resolve identified issues. Confirm all frontmatter dependencies resolve correctly. Verify task passes automated compliance checks. Test task provides sufficient guidance for autonomous execution.
</instructions>

## Framework Context: Task Architecture and XML Tag System

XML Tags Purpose: XML-style tags like `<instructions>` are internal metadata for LLM guidance only. They help LLMs identify section boundaries and processing requirements. These tags MUST NEVER appear in final user output - only clean Markdown should be presented to users.

Task Structure Requirements: All framework tasks must follow exact section ordering from template:
1. Title → 2. Description → 3. Instructions (XML) → 4. Framework Context → 5. Output Format → 6. Success Criteria (XML) → 7. Execution Checklist

Common XML Tags and Usage:

# Task: Core Create Agent

## Description

Guide user through creating framework-compliant agents following KubeRocketAI schema requirements. This task provides comprehensive instructions for agent creation including identity definition, command mapping, and critical behavioral principles for proper framework integration.

<instructions>
Define agent specification. Ask user for agent name, role, purpose, and scope. Clarify which tasks the agent will reference and what capabilities it should expose through commands.

Review framework standards for agent creation. Read agent schema requirements from core-framework-standards.yaml. Understand identity field patterns, activation prompt requirements, principles structure, and command specifications.

Apply agent schema requirements. Create identity section with name matching pattern ^[A-Z][a-zA-Z0-9 .'-]{1,49}$. Define id following pattern ^[a-z][a-z0-9]*(-[a-z0-9]+)*-v[0-9]+$. Set version using semantic versioning. Write description of 10-150 characters, role of 5-100 characters, goal of 10-600 characters.

Include critical activation prompt pattern. Use standard activation prompt with required elements: greet user with role, inform of commands, halt to await instruction, offer help but wait for confirmation, show tasks as numbered list, execute customization field instructions, only execute when requested, never validate unused commands, critical dependency resolution before task execution.

Add critical principles exactly. Include customization priority principle verbatim: IMPORTANT!!! ALWAYS execute instructions from the customization field below. Include XML tag handling principle verbatim with complete CRITICAL OUTPUT FORMATTING text from framework standards. Add agent-specific principles defining scope and behavior patterns.

Define command structure. Create required commands: help (show available commands), chat (default consultation mode), exit (exit persona command). Add agent-specific commands mapped to task capabilities. Ensure all command descriptions are 5-200 characters. Maintain total commands between 3 and 20.

Reference task dependencies. List all tasks agent will use with proper ./.krci-ai/tasks/*.md paths. Verify task files exist or are planned. Ensure command mapping aligns with available tasks.

Format output using agent template. Apply core-agent-template.yaml structure for consistent formatting. Populate all required sections with framework-compliant content. Save to ./.krci-ai/agents/{agent-name}.yaml following naming conventions.

Run framework validation. Execute krci-ai validate to verify schema compliance. Resolve any validation issues before completion. Confirm agent passes all automated checks without errors.
</instructions>

## Framework Context: Agent Architecture and Schema Requirements

Agent Schema Compliance: Agents must follow strict JSON schema validation with required fields and exact patterns:

- `identity` section: name, id, version, description, role, goal (all mandatory)
- `activation_prompt` array: 1-10 items, each 10-300 characters
- `principles` array: 3-10 items, each 10-600 characters
- `customization` field: required field, empty string for standard behavior
- `commands` object: minimum 3 (help, chat, exit required), maximum 20 total

Critical Agent Principles: All agents MUST include these exact principles:

1. Customization Priority: "IMPORTANT!!! ALWAYS execute instructions from the customization field below"
2. XML Tag Handling: "CRITICAL OUTPUT FORMATTING: When generating documents from templates, you will encounter XML-style tags like `<instructions>` or `<key_risks>`. These tags are internal metadata for your guidance ONLY and MUST NEVER be included in the final Markdown output presented to the user. Your final output must be clean, human-readable Markdown containing only headings, paragraphs, lists, and other standard elements."

Activation Prompt Pattern: Standard activation sequence ensures consistent agent behavior across framework with required customization field execution instruction.

Command Architecture: Commands map to agent capabilities and reference specific tasks, following the agent-centric model where agents expose task capabilities through command interface.

## Output Format

- Location: `./.krci-ai/agents/{agent-name}.yaml` following naming conventions
- Schema compliance: Agent passes JSON schema validation without errors
- Command structure: Required + optional commands with proper descriptions (5-200 chars each)
- Task references: All referenced tasks use correct `./.krci-ai/tasks//*.md` paths

# Task: Core Validate Framework

## Description

Execute comprehensive framework validation using CLI tools and manual inspection to ensure component compliance, reference integrity, and operational readiness. This task provides systematic validation procedures for complete framework quality assurance.

<instructions>
Execute CLI validation with appropriate verbosity. Run krci-ai validate for standard framework checking. Use krci-ai validate --verbose for detailed analysis when investigating specific issues. Apply krci-ai validate --quiet for summary-only results if needed. Capture and analyze CLI output for issues and compliance status.

Analyze validation results systematically. Interpret automated validation findings from CLI output. Categorize issues by component type (agents, tasks, templates, data files). Classify severity as critical, warning, or informational. Prioritize resolution order based on impact and dependencies. Understand root causes of validation failures for effective remediation.

Perform manual inspection beyond automated checks. Review agent schema compliance against JSON schema requirements exactly. Confirm tasks follow framework patterns with proper XML guidance structure. Check templates for proper variable usage, naming consistency, and structure. Verify data files are accessible, properly organized, and appropriately formatted.

Validate reference integrity across all components. Confirm agent tasks entries resolve to existing task files at specified paths. Verify task frontmatter dependencies resolve to existing templates under dependencies.templates section. Test task data references resolve correctly under dependencies.data section. Check agent data references to behavioral guidance files resolve properly.

Check component relationship alignment. Verify agents reference tasks appropriate for their capabilities and role. Confirm tasks reference templates that match their output requirements. Test that tasks reference data files providing relevant standards or specifications. Validate command-to-task mapping follows framework patterns across agents.

Assess framework pattern compliance manually. Review components for adherence to established conventions beyond automated validation. Verify agents include critical XML tag handling and customization principles exactly. Confirm tasks use natural paragraph instruction flow without numbered lists. Check self-contained context and framework pattern explanations present.

Validate against framework standards and checklist. Reference core-validation-checklist.md for comprehensive quality assurance criteria. Check components against all critical validation requirements. Verify warning-level best practices are followed. Assess informational excellence criteria where applicable.

Document findings comprehensively. Create validation report organized by component type and severity. List specific issues with exact file paths and line references where applicable. Provide clear remediation guidance for each finding category. Include priority ranking for resolution efforts. Document validation process and timeline for reference.

Implement fixes and revalidate. Address validation failures with specific corrections per remediation guidance. Re-run krci-ai validate after implementing fixes to verify resolution. Confirm complete validation success with zero critical errors. Update validation documentation to record resolution actions and final compliance status.
</instructions>

# Task: Generate Test Cases

## Description

Generate detailed test cases and scenarios based on test plan strategy and Story acceptance criteria, ensuring comprehensive coverage of functional and non-functional requirements. This task translates test plan scenarios into executable test cases with clear steps, expected results, and validation criteria that enable systematic testing execution and quality validation.

## Instructions

<instructions>
Confirm approved test plan exists with defined test scenarios and strategy, Stories with well-defined acceptance criteria are available for test case generation, and BDD dependencies are accessible including `./src/main/resources/README.md` and `./src/main/resources/features/`. HALT if missing. Run prechecks to route user appropriately: if `./src/main/resources/features/` exists but README is missing, propose `onboard-testing`; if both are missing, propose `setup-testing`. Ensure dependencies declared in the YAML frontmatter (testing-standards.md, quality-metrics.md, test-methodologies.md, sdlc-framework.md) are readable before proceeding.

Ask user for input source: available stories under `docs/stories/` to scan and select, specific story file path like `docs/stories/NN.MM.story.md`, or user will paste task context in chat. HALT until input source confirmed and task context obtained.

Summarize planned actions before any search including what will be searched (keywords/themes), where (directories/namespace priority), expected action (extend existing vs create new), and open questions or assumptions. Proceed only after user confirms or refines intent.

Execute discovery phase using universal search for candidates. Build normalized keyword variants (hyphen/underscore/space/camelCase, common prefixes/suffixes like `-remote`, `sast`, `security`), detect domain/context hints (UI vs API, module/subsystem names) from task, and prioritize likely directories/namespaces in repository. ALWAYS PROMPT before search: "Rebuild semantic index now (ALL .feature files) to ensure up-to-date results? [yes/no]". On yes, prefer FAISS vector index (`./.krci-ai/indexes/gherkin-faiss.index` + `.meta.json`) using sentence-transformers with fallback to JSON index under `./.krci-ai/indexes/` if FAISS unavailable. On no, use existing FAISS/JSON index if present, otherwise scan files directly. If user approves rebuild, propose and run (upon approval) appropriate index build command for either FAISS or JSON/SQLite backend.

Use FAISS-first approach if available: encode intent, retrieve top-K candidates (e.g., 10), post-filter lexically using anchors (steps/tags/artifacts), and re-rank. Search across scenario titles, steps, tags, and Examples, including characteristic artifacts discovered in repository. Present top 3-5 candidates with file path and short snippet, then HALT for user choice (extend vs reject).

Review `./src/main/resources/README.md` for process, directory structure, and tagging rules (single source of truth). Analyze `./src/main/resources/features/` per README to determine coverage status (Covered / Partial / Not covered). Use README decision matrix and request confirmation before creating or updating tests.

Generate Gherkin by creating or extending `.feature` files under `./src/main/resources/features/` with proper tags and structure. Ensure traceability by mapping each Story acceptance criterion to specific feature files and scenarios. Reference [sdlc-framework.md](./.krci-ai/data/krci-ai/core-sdlc-framework.md) for test case generation workflow and quality gates. Apply test case design techniques from [test-methodologies.md](./.krci-ai/data/test-methodologies.md).

If user requests extending existing test, ask user to pick target scenario or confirm best match by exact/nearest title or unique anchor step/tag. Prefer in-place edits to that scenario by inserting after specified/matched step anchor and avoiding scenario header duplication. If change represents distinct flow, add new Scenario/Scenario Outline in same file without duplicating existing flows. Create new file only if no suitable host file exists or upon explicit user request. Show minimal diff preview around anchor and ask for confirmation before proceeding.

</instructions>
## Output Format

Gherkin Outputs - Create or update BDD feature specifications:

- Feature files: List of created/updated `.feature` files with paths

- Test data preparation: Define required test data, user accounts, and environment configurations
- Traceability matrix: Map Story acceptance criteria to feature files and scenarios
- Peer review: Review Gherkin with the team and obtain approval

## Content Guidelines

### Test Case Generation Focus Areas

#### Story Acceptance Criteria (Primary Focus)

- Requirement Coverage: Each acceptance criterion must have corresponding test cases
- Positive Scenarios: Test cases validating expected functionality and business rules
- Negative Scenarios: Test cases for error handling and invalid input conditions
- Edge Cases: Test cases for boundary conditions and exceptional scenarios

#### Test Plan Implementation (Execution Focus)

- Scenario Translation: Convert test plan scenarios into detailed, executable test steps
- Test Data Requirements: Specify data needed for test execution and validation
- Environment Setup: Define required test environment configurations and dependencies
- Validation Criteria: Clear expected results and success criteria for each test case

### Quality Standards

### Common Pitfalls to Avoid

- Writing test cases without referencing specific Story acceptance criteria
- Creating overly complex test cases that are difficult to execute and maintain
- Missing negative test cases and edge condition scenarios
- Inadequate test data specification and environment requirements
- Poor traceability between test cases and requirements
- Test cases that cannot be executed independently

### Story Testing Integration

This test case generation should enable comprehensive quality validation by providing:

- Acceptance criteria validation through systematic test case coverage
- Story completion verification through executable test scenarios
- Quality gate enablement through clear pass/fail criteria
- Risk mitigation through comprehensive positive and negative test scenarios

# Task: Edit Testing Settings (Interactive Wizard)

## Description

Interactively edit testing settings stored in `src/main/resources/README.md`. The wizard shows current content for each section and asks whether to change it, add new data, or skip. Changes are applied in-place with a backup created automatically.

## When to Use

- You already have `src/main/resources/README.md` and want to adjust providers, tags, structure, or guidance
- After onboarding or setup, to refine details without regenerating from scratch

## Instructions

<instructions>
Confirm `src/main/resources/README.md` exists and write permissions for `src/main/resources/` are available. HALT if missing. If README is missing but `src/main/resources/features/` exists, propose running `onboard-testing`. If both missing, propose `setup-testing`. Ensure dependencies declared in the YAML frontmatter are readable before proceeding.
</instructions>

## Modes

Choose one of:
- Add new data: append sections/notes without altering existing content
- Edit specific section: pick a section by name and update only it
- Guided edit: iterate all known sections; for each, preview current content and ask to edit or skip

## Known Sections (detected and editable)

- Tests Directory Structure
- How the QA agent works with tests
- Generating Gherkin tests
- Discovery and search workflow
- Local Gherkin index (optional)
- Tagging system
- How to add your existing tests
- Integration with the QA agent
- Maintenance notes (e.g., update this README when structure changes)

The wizard should detect headings by `##`/`###` and operate on those blocks. If a section is not found, offer to create it.

## Interaction Flow

1) Select mode (add, edit specific, guided)
2) Build Quick Section Index from current README headings (H2/H3):
   - Show numbered list like: `1) ## Tests Directory Structure`, `2) ### Tagging system`, ...
   - Only offer sections that actually exist; unknown sections can be created on demand
3) If edit specific:
   - Show list of detected sections with indices
   - Display current content of the chosen section
   - Ask: "Edit this section? [yes/no]"; if yes, accept new markdown text (multiline)
4) If guided:
   - For each section in Quick Section Index order (actual document order):
     - Show current content (trim to reasonable length if very long)
     - Ask: "Edit this section? [yes/no]"; if yes, accept new markdown text
     - Ask: "Continue to next section? [yes/no]"
5) If add new data:
   - Ask for a new section title and markdown body
   - Insert after a chosen anchor section or at the end

## Tag Recommendations (helper)

- Offer provider-agnostic defaults first:
  - Type: `@UI`, `@API`, `@E2E`, `@Integration`, `@Unit`
  - Scope/Suite: `@Smoke`, `@Regression`, `@ShortRegression`, `@Critical`, `@Negative`
  - Non-functional: `@Performance`, `@Security`, `@Accessibility`, `@Compatibility`
  - Lifecycle/Utilities: `@Cleanup`, `@DataSetup`, `@Migration`, `@Flaky`
- Optional domain/subdomain tags:
  - Domain: `@{{DomainPascal}}`
  - Subdomains: `@{{DomainPascal}}Create`, `@{{DomainPascal}}Deploy`, `@{{DomainPascal}}Promote`
- Present suggested lists and ask to insert/update in the Tagging system section

## Safety and Backups

- Before any edit, create `src/main/resources/README.md.bak` (overwrite if exists)
- Validate that resulting README contains the edited headings and is non-empty

## Outputs

- Updated `src/main/resources/README.md`
- Optional: backup at `src/main/resources/README.md.bak`
- Summary of edited sections (titles) for the user

## Success Criteria

- Requested sections updated exactly as confirmed by the user
- README structure and headings preserved or improved
- Tagging guidance consistent with selected providers and domain

# Task: Onboard Existing Gherkin Tests

## Description

Analyze an existing directory of Gherkin `.feature` files and generate a `src/main/resources/README.md` aligned with repository conventions. Onboarding is non-interactive: it performs analysis and writes the README, then reports how to change settings via the edit command.

## When to Use

- You already have `.feature` files but lack `src/main/resources/README.md`
- You are migrating an external Gherkin test suite into this system

## Inputs

- Source directory containing `.feature` files (default: `src/main/resources/features/`)

## Instructions

<instructions>
Confirm source directory exists and contains at least one `.feature` file, `src/main/resources/README.md` does not already exist (otherwise use `edit-testing-settings`), and write permissions for `src/main/resources/` are available. HALT if missing. If `src/main/resources/README.md` already exists, HALT and propose running `edit-testing-settings`. If no `.feature` files are present in the source directory, HALT and propose `setup-testing`. If both `.feature` files and README are present, this flow is not applicable; use `edit-testing-settings` or `generate-test-cases` as needed. Ensure dependencies declared in the YAML frontmatter are readable before proceeding.

</instructions>
## Flow (Non-interactive)

1) Scan and infer domains, UI/API presence, naming convention, tag families (with frequencies and scopes), discovery hints (preferred directories, topics, artifacts).
2) Create `src/main/resources/` if missing and write `src/main/resources/README.md` from [template](./.krci-ai/templates/testing-readme.md) using inferred values and hints.
3) Enrich the README with analysis outputs:
   - Replace the template "Directory structure" code block with the actual tree under `src/main/resources/features/` (preserve readability by limiting depth if very large).
   - Set the naming convention to the detected style (`PascalCase`, `kebab-case`, or `snake_case`).
   - Insert a concise UI vs API coverage summary (presence and high-level distribution).
   - Add a "Current tags in this repository" subsection listing top tags with counts, grouped into recommended families; include an "Additional tags" note for unmapped tags.
   - Append a "Discovery hints for this repository" subsection with preferred directories order, common topics/keywords, and characteristic artifacts.
4) Do not move or rename existing `.feature` files. Do not build local indexes during onboarding.
5) After writing, print a short summary with the README path and instruct the user to run `edit-testing-settings` to adjust any section interactively.

## Safety

- Read-only analysis of `.feature` files; no file moves or renames.
- No local index build (semantic or lexical) is performed in this flow.

## Analysis Heuristics

During onboarding, the agent analyzes the feature tree to infer structure and conventions:

- Domains: inferred from folder names and common path segments (e.g., `payments`, `core`)
- Test types: detect UI (`features/<domain>/*.feature`) and API (`features/api_tests/<domain>/*.feature`) presence
- Naming convention: sample filenames to detect `PascalCase` vs `kebab-case` vs `snake_case`
- Tags: aggregate tags across Feature, Scenario/Scenario Outline, and Examples; record frequency and scope
- Topics/keywords: extract top tokens from filenames and scenario titles (after normalization/stopword removal)
- Characteristic artifacts: detect frequent constants and step markers (e.g., UPPER_CASE tokens, URLs, IDs)
- Directory priority: rank subdirectories by scenario density and tag richness to suggest search order

### Tag Inference and Mapping

Extraction:
- Collect all tokens starting with `@` across Feature, Scenario, and Examples blocks
- Track per-tag frequency and where it appears (scope: Feature | Scenario | Examples)

Normalization:
- Normalize domain to PascalCase for domain-prefixed tags (e.g., `payments` → `Payments`)

Classification (recommended families):
- Type: `@UI`, `@API`, `@E2E`, `@Integration`, `@Unit`
- Scope/Suite: `@Smoke`, `@Regression`, `@ShortRegression`, `@Critical`, `@Negative`
- Non-functional: `@Performance`, `@Security`, `@Accessibility`, `@Compatibility`
- Lifecycle/Utilities: `@Cleanup`, `@DataSetup`, `@Migration`, `@Flaky`
- Optional domain/subdomain tags:
  - Domain: `@{{DomainPascal}}`
  - Subdomains: `@{{DomainPascal}}Create`, `@{{DomainPascal}}Deploy`, `@{{DomainPascal}}Promote` (and similar)

Unknown/unmapped tags:
- Keep a list of tags that don’t map cleanly; include them under an "Additional tags" note in the README so they are documented without enforcing new conventions.

### Discovery/Search Heuristics (repo-specific)

To help future search and extension:
- Preferred directories (ordered): directories ranked by feature density and tag concentration
- Common topics/keywords: top N normalized tokens from filenames and scenario titles
- Characteristic artifacts/steps: frequently recurring constants and step phrases worth using as anchors
- Parity patterns (optional): if parallel provider/module trees exist, note parity expectations

These hints are summarized into the README under a "Discovery hints for this repository" section when applicable.

## README Content (auto-generated)

- Directory structure: reflects the existing on-disk tree (including `api_tests/`, `utility/cleanup` if present)
- Tagging system: recommended families populated with inferred tags; include domain/subdomain tags if detected
- How to add your existing tests: guidance aligned to current placement and detected naming convention
- Discovery and search workflow: standard workflow plus repo-specific discovery hints
- Integration with the QA agent: inputs/outputs as defined by the template
- Additional tags: unmapped tags list (optional)

## Output

- `src/main/resources/README.md` reflecting existing suite structure and inferred conventions
- Console summary with the README path and next-step instruction (`edit-testing-settings`)

## Success Criteria

- README reflects actual on-disk feature layout without prompting the user
- Provider/tags guidance is accurate and actionable for subsequent generation
- Discovery hints help the agent prioritize relevant areas during search
- Further refinements are handled by `edit-testing-settings`

# Task: Setup Testing (First-Run Wizard)

## Description

Interactive, first-run setup that initializes your testing workspace. This wizard asks a short series of questions and then generates a testing README and directory structure for Gherkin-based tests.

## Goal

- Create `src/main/resources/README.md` from a template, filled with your choices
- Create `src/main/resources/features/` directory structure (including optional provider subfolders)
- Establish Gherkin as the single source of truth for test cases

## When to Use

- On a fresh installation where `src/main/resources/README.md` or `src/main/resources/features/` is missing
- When reconfiguring your testing strategy, providers, or tagging conventions

## Instructions

<instructions>
Confirm write permissions for `src/main/resources/` are available. HALT if missing. Ensure dependencies declared in the YAML frontmatter are readable before proceeding.

Execute interactive wizard setup by asking questions in sequence with HALT checkpoints. HALT before starting with intro explaining wizard flow and expected outputs. For each question, ask, HALT for answer, echo back interpreted value, and HALT for confirmation or edits. Gather configuration including domain name for features, test types to include (UI/API), tagging approach (provider-agnostic families or domain-specific), utilities/cleanup flows inclusion, naming convention for feature files, and whether to create starter example file.

Follow wizard contract with HALT checkpoints at critical decision points. Ask about existing features and offer to place them into `src/main/resources/features/` with confirmation. Present concise plan after gathering inputs (directories to create, README sections, files to import/move) and HALT for approval. Show preview of new README (first 20-30 lines and customized sections) plus file/folder actions, and HALT for final confirmation. Allow user to revise inputs or cancel without writing on any negative confirmation. Offer to build local Gherkin index only if at least one non-starter `.feature` file is present.

Create directory structure for `src/main/resources/features/` with domain and provider subfolders based on test types selected. Generate `src/main/resources/README.md` from [template](./.krci-ai/templates/testing-readme.md) by replacing placeholders with user selections, using block-by-block prompting with HALT after each section. Optionally create starter example feature file if requested. Optionally build local Gherkin indexes (FAISS semantic and JSON/SQLite lexical) if non-starter features are present.
</instructions>

## Interactive Questions (Wizard)

Ask the following in sequence. After each answer, confirm or offer a recommended default.

1. Domain name for UI/API test features (e.g., `core`, `payments`)
2. Test types to include (multi-select; default: `UI, API`)
3. Tagging approach (default: provider-agnostic families; optional: domain-specific tags)
4. Include utilities/cleanup flows? (default: `yes`)
5. Naming convention for feature files (default: `PascalCase`, e.g., `PromoteApplication.feature`)
6. Create starter example feature file? (default: `no`)

### Recommended Default Tags

Provider-agnostic families (recommended for most projects):

- Type: `@UI`, `@API`, `@E2E`, `@Integration`, `@Unit`
- Scope/Suite: `@Smoke`, `@Regression`, `@ShortRegression`, `@Critical`, `@Negative`
- Non-functional: `@Performance`, `@Security`, `@Accessibility`, `@Compatibility`
- Lifecycle/Utilities: `@Cleanup`, `@DataSetup`, `@Migration`, `@Flaky`

Optional domain/subdomain tags (enable only if relevant):

- Domain: `@{{DomainPascal}}`
- Subdomains (examples): `@{{DomainPascal}}Create`, `@{{DomainPascal}}Deploy`, `@{{DomainPascal}}Promote`

### Wizard HALT Checkpoints

- Before starting: HALT with intro explaining wizard flow and expected outputs
- For each question: ask → HALT for answer → echo back → HALT for confirmation
- Existing features: recommend placement and HALT for confirmation
- Plan summary: present directories, README sections, files to import/move and HALT for approval
- Diff/preview: show README preview and file/folder actions, HALT for final confirmation
- On any "no": allow user to revise inputs or cancel without writing
- Optional local index: offer only if non-starter `.feature` files present

## Actions

1. Create directories:
   - `src/main/resources/`
   - `src/main/resources/features/`
   - `src/main/resources/features/{{domain_name}}/`
   - For each selected provider:
     - `src/main/resources/features/{{domain_name}}/{{provider}}/` (if UI selected)
     - `src/main/resources/features/api_tests/{{domain_name}}/{{provider}}/` (if API selected)
   - If utilities enabled: `src/main/resources/features/api_tests/utility/cleanup/`

2. Generate `src/main/resources/README.md` from [template](./.krci-ai/templates/testing-readme.md) by replacing placeholders:
   - `{{domain_name}}`
   - `{{providers_csv}}` (comma-separated)
   - `{{include_ui}}` / `{{include_api}}` → `true/false`
   - `{{enforce_parity}}` → `true/false`
   - `{{provider_ui_tags}}`, `{{api_suite_tags}}`, `{{suite_tags}}`
   - `{{naming_convention}}`

   Block-by-block prompting aligned to the template:
   - Tests Directory Structure: show the template section and ask whether to accept as-is or customize notes. HALT.
   - How the QA agent works with tests: show and optionally tailor to project wording. HALT.
   - Discovery and search workflow: show and confirm or edit. HALT.
   - Optional local Gherkin index: show and confirm whether to include. HALT.
   - Tagging system: show recommended families; incorporate user-chosen domain tags. HALT.
   - How to add your existing tests: include chosen naming convention and placement guidance. HALT.
   - Integration with the QA agent: confirm inputs/outputs reflect this project. HALT.

3. Optionally create a starter example feature file if requested.

## Output

- `src/main/resources/README.md` created and aligned with your selections
- Feature directories created for the selected domain and providers
- Optional starter `.feature` file created
- Optional local Gherkin indexes (if chosen):
  - Semantic FAISS index at `./.krci-ai/indexes/gherkin-faiss.index` with metadata `gherkin-faiss.meta.json`
  - Lexical JSON `./.krci-ai/indexes/gherkin-lex.json` and SQLite `./.krci-ai/indexes/gherkin-lex.sqlite`

## Success Criteria

- README exists with your chosen providers, tags, and structure
- Feature directories exist and match the selected test types (UI/API)
- Agent can operate in BDD-only mode using the created README and features

## Notes

- This setup aligns with the QA agent contract: Gherkin is the single source of truth, README is the governing document for process and tags.
- After setup, you can create local Gherkin indexes to speed up discovery; they are optional and can be regenerated anytime.
- After setup, run the discovery/search phase (see generate task) to index existing or starter features and validate provider/tag structure.
- You can rerun this wizard later to adjust configuration; review diffs before committing changes.

# Task: Update Story

## Description

Update existing user story with new requirements, scope refinements, or implementation changes while preserving completed tasks/subtasks and maintaining epic traceability. This task enables controlled story evolution during development while protecting team progress and ensuring Epic alignment.

## Instructions

<instructions>
Confirm the target story file exists in `/docs/stories/` with current implementation status, there is clear business reason for story update (new requirements, scope clarification, task feedback), you understand how changes affect in-progress or completed Tasks/Subtasks, and Product Owner confirms updates maintain Epic goals and traceability. Ensure dependencies declared in the YAML frontmatter are readable before proceeding.

CRITICAL: MANDATORY USER CONSULTATION FIRST - Before making ANY changes to the Story, you MUST ask the user what specific updates they want to make, understand the trigger for changes (new requirements, scope clarification, task feedback, etc.), clarify scope which sections need updating and why, get approval for the proposed changes before implementation, and wait for explicit confirmation before proceeding with any edits.

ONLY AFTER USER CONFIRMATION: Reference [sdlc-framework.md](./.krci-ai/data/krci-ai/core-sdlc-framework.md) for Story update dependencies and downstream impact. Review story status and Tasks/Subtasks before making changes. Use methods from [prioritization-frameworks.md](./.krci-ai/data/prioritization-frameworks.md) for update prioritization. Keep [story.md](./.krci-ai/templates/story.md) template structure and populate new variables. Maintain existing Epic references while ensuring new changes align with Epic goals.

Before applying any update, verify no completed Tasks/Subtasks become invalid, ensure changes maintain Epic traceability and goals, calculate impact on existing acceptance criteria and validation, and record business justification for every change.
</instructions>

## Update Types & Restrictions

<update_restrictions>

### ALLOWED Updates (Safe Changes)

# Task: Create GitHub Issues

## Description

Create GitHub issues (epics, stories, bugs) for KubeRocketCI/kuberocketai repository using existing GitHub templates and GitHub MCP server.

## Prerequisites

<prerequisites>
- GitHub MCP Server: Available and configured
- Repository Access: KubeRocketCI/kuberocketai with issue creation permissions
</prerequisites>

## Instructions

<instructions>

### 1. Gather Requirements

Ask user to specify:

- Type: Epic, Story (Enhancement), or Bug
- Title: Clear, descriptive title
- Repository: Default `KubeRocketCI/kuberocketai` (allow override)
- Labels: Optional extra labels
- Assignees: Default `SergK` (allow override)
- Related Epic #: Optional (adds a note at the end of the body)

Then, based on the selected Type, prompt for fields derived from the corresponding template (see Template-Driven Rendering):

- Epic (feature_request.yml):
  - Feature Summary (required)
  - Problem Statement (required)
  - Proposed Solution (required)
  - Alternative Solutions (optional)
  - Usage Examples (optional)
  - Acceptance Criteria (optional)

- Story/Enhancement (enhancement.yml):
  - Current Functionality (required)
  - Current Limitations (required)
  - Proposed Improvement (required)
  - Expected Benefits (required)
  - Implementation Examples (optional)
  - Testing Considerations (optional)

- Bug (bug_report.yml):
  - Bug Description (required)
  - Steps to Reproduce (required)
  - Expected Behavior (required)
  - Actual Behavior (required)
  - Error Logs/Output (optional)

### 2. Preview & Confirm Before Creation

CRITICAL: Always confirm with user before creating any GitHub issue:

- Show a full preview of the issue body rendered from the selected template and provided fields (H2 headers per textarea label, in template order)
- Ask for explicit approval: "Should I create this issue?"
- Only proceed after user confirms "yes"

### 3. Label Strategy

Base Labels: Use template defaults from `.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/*.yml`

Repository Extensions (add if conditions match):

- All Epics → +`epic`
- Breaking changes mentioned → +`breaking-change`
- Technical debt scope → +`technical-debt`
- High priority/complexity → +`critical`

### 4. Create Issue

### Template-Driven Rendering (for API/MCP creation)

When creating issues programmatically, derive the output structure from the corresponding GitHub Issue Template to keep a single source of truth.

- Locate template by type:
  - Epic → `.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/feature_request.yml`
  - Story/Enhancement → `.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/enhancement.yml`
  - Bug → `.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/bug_report.yml`

- Parse the template YAML and render sections in order:
  - For each `body` item with `type: textarea`, use `attributes.label` as a Markdown H2 header (e.g., `## {label}`)
  - Preserve item ordering from the template
  - Optionally include `attributes.description` as helper text under the header (plain text), if needed
  - Respect `validations.required`; HALT if any required textarea is missing in user input

- Metadata handling:
  - Title: use the template `title` prefix unless a custom title is provided by the user
  - Labels: include template default labels plus any user-specified labels
  - Assignees: include template default assignees unless overridden
  - Non-textarea fields (dropdowns, inputs, checkboxes): if user provided values, include a short "Metadata" section listing key-value pairs

- Validation:
  - CRITICAL: If the mapped template file is missing, HALT and report the exact missing path; do not create the issue
  - If any required field per template is missing, HALT and list missing fields
  - If `Type` is not one of: Epic, Story (Enhancement), Bug — HALT and show the allowed values

- Conventions:
  - Keep content concise and outcome-focused; avoid command-level testing instructions in high-level sections
  - Maintain template order and naming to match the UI form experience

  </instructions>

## Output Format

- Location: GitHub issue in the target repository (return created issue URL)
- Type: Epic → Feature Request, Story → Enhancement, Bug → Bug Report
- Title: Use template title prefix unless user provides an explicit title override
- Labels/Assignees: Apply template defaults plus any user-provided additions

## Execution Checklist

### Discovery Phase

- Validate Type is one of: Epic, Story (Enhancement), Bug
- Verify mapped template file exists for the selected Type
- Collect required fields as defined by the template (textareas with required: true)

### Planning Phase

- Render preview using template labels as H2 headers, in template order
- Validate all required fields populated; list any missing and HALT
- Apply label strategy: template defaults + repository extensions
- Confirm labels and assignees (template defaults + repository patterns)

### Creation Phase

- Create issue via GitHub MCP server
- Append `Relates to: #<n>` if provided
- Return issue URL to the user

## Success Criteria

<success_criteria>
- User Confirmation: User explicitly approved issue creation
- Issue Created: GitHub issue successfully created
- Correct Template: Appropriate GitHub template used
- Proper Labels: Template-required labels applied
- URL Provided: GitHub issue URL returned to user
</success_criteria>

## Important Notes

- Never create issues without user confirmation
- GitHub templates handle all field requirements automatically
- To link to an epic, provide the "Related Epic #"; the agent will append `Relates to: #<number>` automatically
- All created issues auto-assigned to SergK as repository owner

# Task: Create Story

## Description

Create user-focused requirements with implementation tasks and acceptance criteria that break down Epic features into actionable development work. This story provides specific user value and clear implementation guidance for development teams.

## Instructions

<instructions>
Confirm target Epic exists in `/docs/epics/` directory and understand Epic problem, goal, and scope. Identify target user persona specified in Epic and define specific functionality this Story will deliver. Ask user for exact Epic file path and Story scope if not clear before proceeding.

Reference [sdlc-framework.md](./.krci-ai/data/krci-ai/core-sdlc-framework.md) for Story dependencies and naming conventions throughout creation process. Apply prioritization methods from [prioritization-frameworks.md](./.krci-ai/data/prioritization-frameworks.md) to validate Story importance and sequence. Use [story.md](./.krci-ai/templates/story.md) template with proper naming pattern `/docs/stories/{epic_number}.{story_number}.story.md`.

Ensure Epic traceability by referencing parent Epic and mapping to specific Epic deliverables throughout Story content. Create comprehensive content with rich, detailed stories including extensive technical context and strategic reasoning. Provide technical depth with detailed architectural background, implementation guidance, and quality considerations for all Story elements.

Integrate strategic context by explaining purpose, significance, and system integration aspects for all story components. Follow story.md template structure exactly and populate all template variables correctly with complete Story definition, acceptance criteria, and implementation tasks.
</instructions>

# Task: Create Epic

## Description

Create clear epic with problem statement, goal, scope, and implementation approach that breaks down PRD requirements into manageable high-level features. This epic enables Story creation and provides a clear feature grouping for development teams.

## Instructions

<instructions>
Confirm the target output path in `/docs/epics/{epic_number}-epic-{slug}.md` including the next sequential epic number and slug, and verify the PRD at `/docs/prd/prd.md` is accessible. Do not proceed until dependencies from the YAML frontmatter are readable.

Reference [sdlc-framework.md](./.krci-ai/data/krci-ai/core-sdlc-framework.md) for artifact flow, apply methods from [prioritization-frameworks.md](./.krci-ai/data/prioritization-frameworks.md), and use the `epic.md` template. Maintain PRD traceability and follow the agent-optimized template requirements exactly.
</instructions>

## Agent-Optimized Template Enforcement

<template_enforcement>
CRITICAL: All epics must follow these agent-optimized patterns:

- Goal Format: MUST follow Enable [specific outcome] for [target %] of [user type] within [timeline]
- Dependencies Structure: MUST group using exact headers Epic Dependencies:, System Dependencies:, External Dependencies:
- Acceptance Criteria: MUST include validation method AND verification command for each criterion
- User Stories: MUST use phase-based grouping with Phase X: Name headers and dependency notation

### Quality Gates

Before epic creation, verify:

1. Goal Measurability: Goal contains specific outcome, target percentage, user type, and timeline
2. Dependencies Grouping: All dependencies properly categorized with required headers
3. Acceptance Criteria Commands: Each criterion includes both validation method and testable command
4. Agent-Parseable Structure: Consistent formatting enables automated processing

### Validation Commands

Post-creation verification:
- Goal format: echo "[goal_text]" | grep -E "Enable .*for [0-9]+% .* within .*"
- Dependencies structure: grep -E "^(Epic|System|External) Dependencies:" [epic_file]
- Acceptance commands: grep -E "Command: \`.*\`" [epic_file]
</template_enforcement>

## Output Format

- Location: `/docs/epics/{epic_number}-epic-{slug}.md` (EXACT naming pattern)
- Epic numbering: Sequential number based on existing epics (check `/docs/epics/` folder)
- Slug format: Lowercase, hyphenated description (e.g., "ide-integration", "core-engine")
- Downstream Enable: Enables Story creation at `/docs/stories/`

## Success Criteria

<success_criteria>
- File saved to /docs/epics/{epic_number}-epic-{slug}.md with correct naming
- PRD traceability clear connection to specific BR/NFR requirements
- Problem clarity epic solves a specific user problem with defined scope
- Goal measurability epic completion criteria are specific and testable
- Story readiness epic provides enough detail for Story breakdown
- Template compliance all template variables populated correctly

# Task: Create Project Charter

## Description

Create a comprehensive project charter that formally authorizes the project and provides the Project Manager with the authority to apply organizational resources to project activities. As defined in PMBoK, the project charter is a document issued by the project initiator or sponsor that formally authorizes the existence of a project and provides the Project Manager with the authority to apply organizational resources to project activities.

## Instructions

<instructions>
Confirm the exact output document you will create using [project-charter-template.md](./.krci-ai/templates/project-charter-template.md) and verify that dependencies declared in the YAML frontmatter are accessible. Do not proceed until initiating inputs (business case, stakeholders, budget/timeline context) are available or explicitly provided.

Reference [project-management-methodology.md](./.krci-ai/data/project-management-methodology.md) for PMBoK standards and charter best practices. Review business case, project request, or initiating documentation to identify project purpose, business need, strategic alignment, high-level scope and deliverables, key stakeholders and their roles, and preliminary success criteria. Identify project sponsor, key decision makers, primary stakeholders and their interests, stakeholder expectations and requirements, and potential resistance or support factors.

Define project purpose and business justification by articulating the problem or opportunity being addressed, establishing strategic alignment with organizational objectives, and documenting expected business value and benefits. Define high-level project scope and boundaries, list major deliverables and milestones, identify what is explicitly excluded from scope, and document assumptions and constraints.

Define measurable project success criteria, establish acceptance criteria for major deliverables, document key performance indicators, and identify quality standards and expectations. Define Project Manager authority and responsibilities, document preliminary resource requirements, establish budget parameters and financial authority, and identify organizational support and governance structure.

Identify high-level project risks and uncertainties, document key assumptions and dependencies, assess potential impact on project success, and outline initial risk mitigation strategies. Document time, cost, and resource constraints, identify regulatory or compliance requirements, note technology or environmental limitations, and address stakeholder or organizational constraints.

Use the [project-charter-template.md](./.krci-ai/templates/project-charter-template.md) for consistent formatting and ensure all required sections are completed thoroughly with appropriate level of detail for charter audience formatted for executive-level review and approval. Review charter with key stakeholders for accuracy, validate alignment with business objectives and strategy, confirm resource commitments and expectations, and ensure all critical elements are addressed.

# Task: Create Risk Register

## Description

Create a comprehensive risk register that identifies, analyzes, and documents project risks along with their response strategies and ownership assignments. The risk register serves as the central repository for risk management throughout the project lifecycle, following PMBoK risk management principles and organizational best practices.

## Instructions

<instructions>
Confirm the exact output you will create using [risk-register-template.md](./.krci-ai/templates/risk-register-template.md) and verify access to inputs (charter/scope, WBS, stakeholder data). Ensure YAML frontmatter dependencies are readable before proceeding.

Reference [project-management-methodology.md](./.krci-ai/data/project-management-methodology.md) for PMBoK risk management principles. Conduct brainstorming sessions with project team and stakeholders, review project documentation for potential risk sources, analyze work breakdown structure for activity-specific risks, consider external factors and organizational constraints, and review lessons learned from similar projects.

Categorize identified risks across technical, schedule, cost, organizational, external, and quality dimensions. Assess probability of occurrence for each identified risk, evaluate potential impact on project objectives, use probability-impact matrix to prioritize risks, and consider risk interdependencies and cumulative effects using standard probability scales (Very Low 0.1 to Very High 0.9) and impact scales (Very Low to Very High).

Develop response strategies for negative risks including avoid, mitigate, transfer, or accept approaches. For positive risks, use exploit, enhance, share, or accept strategies. Define specific response actions and activities, assign risk owners and response responsibilities, establish trigger conditions and early warning indicators, determine resource requirements and budget allocations, and set timeline for response implementation.

Define risk status tracking and reporting procedures, establish risk review meeting schedule and participants, create risk escalation criteria and procedures, and develop risk communication and stakeholder notification protocols. Define risk response effectiveness measurement, establish residual risk acceptance criteria, create secondary risk identification and response procedures, and document risk register update and maintenance procedures.

Use the [risk-register-template.md](./.krci-ai/templates/risk-register-template.md) to create comprehensive risk register with complete risk entries including ID, description, category, probability and impact assessments, response strategies, and ownership assignments.

# Task: Create Pitch Deck

## Description

Create a concise, high-impact pitch deck (3-5 slides) that transforms product features into an emotional story driving immediate action. Focus on maximum "WOW factor" through powerful visuals, compelling problem-solution narrative, and professional design that makes audiences stop and say "I need this product" within minutes, not hours.

## Instructions

<instructions>
Confirm the exact output path `/docs/marketing/pitch-deck.md` you will create. Verify the PRD at `/docs/prd/prd.md` is accessible as primary source and product demo or MVP is available for showcasing. Ensure dependencies declared in the YAML frontmatter are readable. Plan to ask the user interactive questions for any gaps not covered in the PRD including target audience specifics, presentation tone, competitive context, and presentation objectives. Optional marketing brief and brand guidelines enhance output but are not required.

Load context by reading all reference assets to gain framework knowledge and templates. Gather information by collecting prerequisites and analyzing PRD and MVP content. Select optimal presentation framework based on audience and content strategy from available options including Pain-Gains-Reveals, PAS, BAB, and SCRAP which all adapt to 3-5 slides.

Structure content by applying chosen framework to organize pitch deck slides and integrate persuasion elements. Use presentation frameworks from [business-frameworks.md](./.krci-ai/data/business-frameworks.md) as mandatory requirement. Generate final pitch deck using [pitch-deck-template.md](./.krci-ai/templates/pitch-deck-template.md) structure with visual design guidance and populate all template variables precisely.
</instructions>

## Output Format

- Location: `/docs/marketing/pitch-deck.md` (EXACT path and filename)
- Length: 3-5 slides maximum for focused, high-impact presentation
- Format: Structured markdown with concise slide descriptions optimized for immediate visual implementation
- Downstream Enable: Ready for PowerPoint/presentation tool conversion and executive-level presentations

## Success Criteria

<success_criteria>
- File saved to `/docs/marketing/pitch-deck-{number}.md`
- Slide count is 3-5 slides maximum for optimal attention span
- Opening hook creates immediate engagement and curiosity within first 30 seconds
- Problem statement resonates emotionally with target audience pain points
- Solution reveal has clear AHA moment that demonstrates product value
- Visual design descriptions enable compelling slide creation with modern aesthetics
- Call to action is specific and drives desired next steps
</success_criteria>

## Execution Checklist

### Step 1: Load Context

<load_context>
- Read business-frameworks.md: Load Pain-Gains-Reveals, PAS, BAB, SCRAP framework knowledge
- Read pitch-deck-template.md: Load template structure and formatting requirements
- Read sdlc-framework.md: Understand artifact dependencies and workflow context
</load_context>

### Step 2: Gather Information (PRD-First + Interactive)

<gather_information>
- Extract PRD information: Follow template PRD Integration Guide for specific extraction instructions
- Review MVP: Identify key capabilities for demonstration
- Ask user for gaps: Follow template PRD Integration Guide for interactive questions to fill missing information

Interactive Question Examples:

- Who is your specific presentation audience? (e.g., Tech executives at SaaS companies or Series A investors)
- What tone should this presentation have? (professional, innovative, empathetic, or other)
- What are your main competitors in this space, and how do you differentiate?
- What's your primary objective for this presentation? (funding, partnerships, sales, etc.)
</gather_information>

### Step 3: Select Framework

<select_framework>
- Choose framework: Follow template Framework Adaptation Guide to select optimal framework based on audience and content strategy. Default: Start with Pain-Gains-Reveals framework unless user specifies preference for PAS, BAB, or SCRAP
- Determine slide count: Use template framework structure to adapt to 3-5 slides based on content depth
</select_framework>

### Step 4: Structure Content

<structure_content>
- Apply framework: Structure slides according to chosen framework methodology
- Integrate persuasion: Add Social Proof, Authority, Scarcity elements
- Add emotional connection: Use Customer Emotion Guidelines for human feelings

Content Integration Guide: Start by mapping your framework structure to emotional touchpoints - for Pain-Gains-Reveals, weave frustration/hope emotions into Pain slides, excitement/relief into Gains, and confidence/authority into Reveals. Layer persuasion psychology throughout: use Social Proof in problem validation, Authority in solution presentation, and Scarcity in competitive differentiation. Apply STAR method (Situation-Task-Action-Result) for any proof points, ensuring each slide contributes to the emotional journey from problem awareness to solution commitment. Follow all template guidance sections for implementation details.
</structure_content>

### Step 5: Create Output

<create_output>
- Populate template variables: Follow template Variable Source Guide to map gathered information to template variables
- Generate pitch deck: Use template structure with chosen framework content following Framework Adaptation Guide
- Add visual descriptions: Follow template visual design format examples for each slide
- Save file: Place at exact location `/docs/marketing/pitch-deck-{number}.md`
</create_output>

## Content Guidelines

</error_prevention>

### WOW Factor Design Principles for 3-5 Slides

<wow_factor_principles>
- Slide 1 - Hook: Open with surprising statistic, compelling question, or bold problem statement that audience immediately recognizes
- Slide 2-3 - Solution: Present clear before/after transformation with visual impact and concrete value demonstration
- Slide 4-5 - Action: Combine proof (traction/testimonial) with specific call to action that audience can take immediately
- Visual Impact: Each slide must standalone - no gradual build-up, immediate clarity and impact
- Message Density: Pack maximum emotional and logical impact into minimal content - every word counts
</wow_factor_principles>

### Framework Validation Checklist

<framework_validation>
Before finalizing the pitch deck, verify strategic framework application:

- Framework selection rationale: Chosen framework aligns with audience type and content strategy
- Framework consistency: All slides follow chosen framework structure and logical flow

# Task: Refine Project Brief

## Description

Incorporate validation feedback and evidence into the project brief, updating sections with validated information, improved confidence levels, and refined assumptions. This task synthesizes multiple validation results to create an enhanced, evidence-based project brief.

This task uses [validation frameworks](./.krci-ai/data/validation-frameworks.md) and may utilize the [assumption tracker template](./.krci-ai/templates/assumption-tracker-template.md) for tracking refinements.

## Instructions

<instructions>
Confirm the original project brief exists at `/docs/prd/project-brief.md`, one or more validation reports are completed, assumption tracker is updated with validation results, and stakeholder feedback on validation results is available. Ensure dependencies declared in the YAML frontmatter are readable before proceeding.

Collect and analyze all completed validation results from `/docs/prd/brief-validation-*.md`. Review validation reports to extract key findings that impact project brief sections. Identify confidence level changes based on validation evidence and document required brief updates. Aggregate evidence quality scores across all validations, identify strongest and weakest evidence areas, update overall brief confidence based on evidence assessment, and flag areas requiring additional validation.

Update project brief sections systematically with validation results. Enhance executive summary by updating problem description with validated evidence, refining solution approach based on validation findings, updating business value projections with validated metrics, and enhancing scope definition with validated constraints. Refine problem statement by integrating root cause analysis findings, adding quantified problem evidence from validation, updating problem scope based on validation boundaries, and enhancing impact assessment with validated metrics.

Enhance target users section by updating user segments with Jobs-to-be-Done validation, adding validated demographic and behavioral data, including opportunity scores and user priorities, and refining user context with journey validation insights. Improve success metrics by updating metrics with SMART criteria validation results, adding baseline data discovered during validation, refining targets based on evidence and benchmarks, and balancing leading and lagging indicators appropriately.

Update constraints and risks by adding constraints discovered during validation, updating risk assessment with validation insights, including evidence-based risk probability estimates, and enhancing mitigation strategies with validated approaches. For each section, update validation checkpoints by marking completed validations as verified, updating confidence levels based on evidence quality, documenting validation methods used, and including evidence sources and quality assessments.

Integrate assumption tracker updates by updating assumption status based on validation results, adding new assumptions discovered during validation, removing or modifying disproven assumptions, and prioritizing remaining assumptions for future validation. Ensure 2-3 page length limit maintained, verify executive-ready language and structure, confirm all sections have appropriate evidence support, and validate SDLC integration requirements met.

Prepare stakeholder review by creating summary of changes made based on validation, highlighting areas of increased or decreased confidence, documenting remaining uncertainties and validation needs, and creating stakeholder presentation of refined brief.

# Task: Enhance Project Brief

## Description

Upgrade an existing standard project brief to the advanced validation flow, adding business framework validation, evidence collection, and assumption tracking. This task bridges standard rapid creation with comprehensive validation when project importance or risk increases.

This task uses the [advanced project brief template](./.krci-ai/templates/project-brief-template-advanced.md) and [validation frameworks](./.krci-ai/data/validation-frameworks.md) for comprehensive enhancement.

## Instructions

<instructions>
Confirm the existing project brief at `/docs/prd/project-brief.md` is accessible and created with standard flow. Verify the project has increased in strategic importance, budget, or risk level, stakeholders are requesting evidence-based validation, and time is available for comprehensive validation process (2-4 weeks). Ensure dependencies declared in the YAML frontmatter are readable before proceeding.

Follow this systematic enhancement process to upgrade the brief to advanced validation flow with business framework validation, evidence collection, and assumption tracking:

# Task: Update Project Brief

## Description

Update an existing project brief with new information, scope changes, or refined understanding while maintaining strategic alignment and enabling downstream SDLC artifacts. Focus on change impact assessment and downstream artifact management to ensure existing PRD and Epic artifacts remain aligned with strategic changes.

## Instructions

<instructions>
Confirm `/docs/prd/project-brief.md` exists and is properly accessible, there is clear reason for update (strategic shifts, market changes, new insights, stakeholder feedback, resource changes), you understand how changes affect dependent PRD and downstream artifacts, and key stakeholders are aware of planned strategic changes. Ensure dependencies declared in the YAML frontmatter are readable before proceeding.

CRITICAL: MANDATORY USER CONSULTATION FIRST - Before making ANY changes to the Project Brief, you MUST ask the user what specific updates they want to make, understand the trigger for the changes (strategic shifts, market changes, stakeholder feedback, resource changes, etc.), clarify scope which sections need updating and why, get approval for the proposed changes before implementation, and wait for explicit confirmation before proceeding with any edits.

ONLY AFTER USER CONFIRMATION: Reference [sdlc-framework.md](./.krci-ai/data/krci-ai/core-sdlc-framework.md) for change impact assessment. Apply methodologies from [business-frameworks.md](./.krci-ai/data/business-frameworks.md). Maintain [project-brief-template.md](./.krci-ai/templates/project-brief-template.md) structure. Identify which PRD artifacts need updates.
</instructions>

# Task: Validate Problem Statement

## Description

Apply Lean Startup Problem-Solution Fit Assessment framework to validate problem statement accuracy, evidence quality, and strategic alignment. This validation ensures the problem is real, urgent, and worth solving while identifying gaps that could impact project success.

This validation uses [validation frameworks](./.krci-ai/data/validation-frameworks.md) and outputs results using the [validation report template](./.krci-ai/templates/validation-report-template.md).

## Instructions

<instructions>
Confirm project brief with problem statement section exists, basic problem research or stakeholder input is available, access to potential users or customer data is accessible, and competitive landscape understanding is available. Ensure dependencies declared in the YAML frontmatter are readable before proceeding.

Apply Lean Startup Problem-Solution Fit Assessment framework from [validation-frameworks.md](./.krci-ai/data/validation-frameworks.md) to validate problem statement accuracy, evidence quality, and strategic alignment. Extract and structure the problem hypothesis from the current project brief including core problem statement, problem scope (included/excluded), affected user segments, and problem context (when, where, why). Use [validation-report-template.md](./.krci-ai/templates/validation-report-template.md) for output.
</instructions>

## Problem Hypothesis Structure

```markdown
Problem Hypothesis: {{user_segment}} experiences {{problem_description}} when {{situation_context}}, resulting in {{negative_impact}}.

Specific Claims to Validate:
- Problem occurs for {{user_segment}} with frequency of {{frequency_claim}}
- Problem causes {{impact_type}} impact measured by {{impact_metric}}
- Current solutions fail because {{solution_gap_reason}}
- Problem urgency driven by {{urgency_factors}}
```

### Phase 2: Lean Startup Validation Framework Application

#### Step 1: Problem Validation Evidence Collection

Customer Interview Validation:
- Conduct minimum 10 target user interviews
- Use structured interview guide focusing on problem experiences
- Document specific problem scenarios and pain points
- Quantify problem frequency and impact per user

Quantified Problem Metrics:
- Collect measurable indicators of problem existence
- Support ticket data, time spent on workarounds, cost of current solutions
- User behavior analytics showing problem manifestation
- Business impact data (revenue loss, efficiency reduction)

Competitive Analysis:
- Document existing solutions and their limitations
- Identify solution gaps that validate problem persistence
- Assess market demand through competitive pricing and adoption
- Analyze competitor positioning to validate problem importance

#### Step 2: Problem-Solution Fit Assessment

Problem Validation Scoring (1-10 scale):
- Problem Intensity: How painful is the problem for users?
- Problem Frequency: How often do users experience this problem?
- Problem Reach: How many users/companies experience this problem?
- Problem Urgency: How urgent is solving this problem for users?

Evidence Quality Assessment:
- Primary evidence percentage (direct user research vs secondary sources)
- Evidence recency (how recent is the supporting data)
- Evidence diversity (multiple source types and perspectives)
- Evidence reliability (credible sources and methodologies)

#### Step 3: Solution Hypothesis Validation

Solution Approach Assessment:
- Does the proposed solution address identified root causes?
- Is the solution technically and commercially feasible?
- Does the solution create meaningful differentiation vs alternatives?
- Can the solution be delivered within stated constraints?

Solution Desirability Testing:
- User reaction to proposed solution approach
- Willingness to pay or switch from current solutions
- Feature prioritization based on problem-solving value
- Solution-market fit assessment

### Phase 3: Evidence Analysis and Validation

#### Evidence Quality Framework

Primary Evidence Sources (Highest confidence):
- Direct customer interviews with problem validation
- First-party usage data showing problem manifestation
- Customer support data quantifying problem frequency
- User research studies with problem-focused findings

Secondary Evidence Sources (Moderate confidence):
- Industry reports mentioning related problems
- Competitive analysis revealing solution gaps
- Expert opinions on problem significance
- Market research highlighting related pain points

Evidence Confidence Scoring:
- High (80-100%): Multiple primary sources, quantified data, recent research
- Medium (60-79%): Mix of primary/secondary, some quantification, reasonably recent
- Low (40-59%): Primarily secondary sources, limited quantification, dated research
- Very Low (<40%): Assumptions without validation, anecdotal evidence only

#### Validation Results Synthesis

Problem-Solution Fit Score Calculation:

```txt
Problem Score = (Intensity + Frequency + Reach + Urgency) / 4
Solution Score = (Root Cause Fit + Feasibility + Differentiation + Deliverability) / 4
Overall Fit = (Problem Score + Solution Score) / 2
```

Fit Assessment Thresholds:
- Strong Fit (8-10): High confidence to proceed with current problem/solution
- Moderate Fit (6-7.9): Some refinement needed, additional validation recommended
- Weak Fit (4-5.9): Significant issues identified, major refinement required
- Poor Fit (<4): Problem or solution hypothesis needs fundamental revision

### Phase 4: Validation Results Documentation

#### Create Validation Report

Use validation report template to document:
- Framework methodology and process followed
- Evidence collected with quality assessment
- Problem-solution fit scores and rationale
- Key findings and insights
- Assumptions validated, challenged, or identified
- Recommendations for project brief updates

#### Update Project Brief

Based on validation results:
- Enhance problem statement with validated evidence
- Update confidence levels and assumption tracking
- Revise problem scope or focus based on findings
- Add validation checkpoint completion status

#### Update Assumption Tracker

Document assumption changes:
- Mark validated assumptions with evidence sources
- Update confidence levels based on validation results
- Add new assumptions identified during validation
- Prioritize remaining assumptions for future validation

## Output Format

<output_format>
- Primary Output: `/docs/prd/brief-validation-problem.md` using validation report template

# Task: Validate Success Metrics

## Description

Apply SMART criteria and OKR alignment frameworks to validate success metrics quality, achievability, and strategic alignment. This validation ensures metrics are specific, measurable, achievable, relevant, and time-bound while supporting organizational objectives.

This validation uses [validation frameworks](./.krci-ai/data/validation-frameworks.md) and outputs results using the [validation report template](./.krci-ai/templates/validation-report-template.md).

## Instructions

<instructions>
Confirm project brief with success metrics section exists, baseline data or historical performance data is available, organizational OKR or strategic goals are documented, and industry benchmark data is accessible. Ensure dependencies declared in the YAML frontmatter are readable before proceeding.

Apply SMART criteria and OKR alignment frameworks from [validation-frameworks.md](./.krci-ai/data/validation-frameworks.md) to validate success metrics quality, achievability, and strategic alignment. Extract current success metrics from project brief including business metrics (revenue, cost savings, market share), user metrics (adoption, engagement, satisfaction), performance metrics (system performance, reliability), and operational metrics (efficiency, productivity). Use [validation-report-template.md](./.krci-ai/templates/validation-report-template.md) for output.
</instructions>

## Metrics Hypothesis Structure

```markdown
Success Metrics Hypothesis: {{project_name}} success measured by achieving:
- Business Impact: {{business_metric}} from {{baseline}} to {{target}} by {{date}}
- User Impact: {{user_metric}} from {{baseline}} to {{target}} by {{date}}
- Performance Impact: {{performance_metric}} from {{baseline}} to {{target}} by {{date}}

Specific Claims to Validate:
- Baseline measurements: {{baseline_claims}}
- Target achievability: {{target_claims}}
- Timeline feasibility: {{timeline_claims}}
- Measurement capability: {{measurement_claims}}
```

### Phase 2: SMART Criteria Validation Framework

#### SMART Assessment Process

For each success metric, evaluate against SMART criteria:

Specific Validation (1-5 scale):
- Is the metric clearly defined without ambiguity?
- Can stakeholders understand what exactly will be measured?
- Is the metric scope bounded and focused?
- Does the metric avoid vague or subjective language?

Measurable Validation (1-5 scale):
- Can the metric be quantified with specific numbers?
- Are measurement tools and data sources identified?
- Is the measurement process documented and reliable?
- Can progress be tracked throughout project lifecycle?

Achievable Validation (1-5 scale):
- Is the target realistic given available resources?
- Are there precedents for similar achievements?
- Have constraints and limitations been considered?
- Is the metric within team/organization control or influence?

Relevant Validation (1-5 scale):
- Does the metric align with business objectives?
- Will achieving this metric create meaningful value?
- Is the metric important to key stakeholders?
- Does the metric contribute to strategic goals?

Time-bound Validation (1-5 scale):
- Is there a clear deadline or timeframe?
- Are there intermediate milestones defined?
- Is the timeline realistic for metric achievement?
- Are dependencies and risks to timeline identified?

#### SMART Score Calculation

```
Total SMART Score = Specific + Measurable + Achievable + Relevant + Time-bound

Interpretation:
- 20-25: Excellent metrics, high confidence to proceed
- 15-19: Good metrics, minor refinement recommended
- 10-14: Moderate metrics, significant improvement needed
- <10: Poor metrics, fundamental revision required
```

### Phase 3: OKR Alignment Validation

#### Organizational Alignment Assessment

Objective Alignment:
- Does project objective align with company/department OKRs?
- Is the objective inspirational and directionally correct?
- Does the objective contribute to higher-level strategic goals?
- Is the objective clear enough to guide decision-making?

Key Result Quality:
- Are key results outcome-focused rather than activity-focused?
- Do key results collectively indicate objective achievement?
- Are key results ambitious yet achievable (60-70% confidence)?
- Do key results avoid measuring inputs or activities?

#### OKR Integration Analysis

```markdown
Company/Department OKR: {{higher_level_okr}}
Project Objective: {{project_objective}}
Alignment Score: {{alignment_score}}/10

Key Results Analysis:
KR1: {{key_result_1}}
- Outcome Focus: {{outcome_score_1}}/5
- Measurability: {{measurability_score_1}}/5
- Ambition Level: {{ambition_score_1}}/5
- Achievement Confidence: {{confidence_score_1}}%

KR2: {{key_result_2}}
- Outcome Focus: {{outcome_score_2}}/5
- Measurability: {{measurability_score_2}}/5
- Ambition Level: {{ambition_score_2}}/5
- Achievement Confidence: {{confidence_score_2}}%

Overall OKR Quality Score: {{okr_total_score}}/50
```

### Phase 4: Leading/Lagging Indicator Analysis

#### Indicator Balance Assessment

Leading Indicators (Predictive metrics):
- Identify metrics that predict future outcomes
- Validate correlation with historical data
- Assess controllability and actionability
- Define measurement frequency and reporting

Lagging Indicators (Outcome metrics):
- Identify metrics that measure final results
- Validate as true measures of success
- Assess measurement accuracy and reliability
- Define measurement and reporting process

#### Balanced Scorecard Creation

```markdown
Leading Indicators (Early Warning System):
1. {{leading_indicator_1}}: {{description}} (Frequency: {{frequency}})
2. {{leading_indicator_2}}: {{description}} (Frequency: {{frequency}})

Lagging Indicators (Success Measurement):
1. {{lagging_indicator_1}}: {{description}} (Frequency: {{frequency}})
2. {{lagging_indicator_2}}: {{description}} (Frequency: {{frequency}})

Predictive Relationships:
- {{leading_indicator}} correlates with {{lagging_indicator}} (R² = {{correlation}})
- Time lag: {{time_lag_period}}
- Confidence in relationship: {{relationship_confidence}}%
```

### Phase 5: Evidence Collection and Validation

#### Baseline Data Validation

Data Collection Requirements:
- Historical performance data for achievability assessment
- Industry benchmark data for target calibration
- Measurement system reliability validation
- Data source accessibility and cost assessment

#### Benchmark Analysis

Industry Benchmarking:

# Task: Create Project Brief (Advanced)

## Description

Create a comprehensive project brief using advanced validation workflow with business framework methodology, evidence collection, and stakeholder validation. This advanced version extends the standard project brief creation with systematic validation, assumption tracking, and quality assurance for high-stakes projects requiring executive approval or comprehensive stakeholder buy-in.

This task leverages [validation frameworks](./.krci-ai/data/validation-frameworks.md) and the [advanced project brief template](./.krci-ai/templates/project-brief-template-advanced.md) for comprehensive project analysis.

Use Advanced Flow When:
- High-stakes projects (>$100K budget, >6 month timeline)
- Strategic initiatives requiring executive approval
- Market uncertainty or unvalidated assumptions
- Stakeholder validation and evidence-based decision making required
- Competitive or complex market environment

## Instructions

<instructions>
Confirm this advanced validation flow is justified (high-stakes project >$100K, executive approval needed, market uncertainty, or stakeholder validation required). Ensure 2-4 weeks are available for the multi-session validation process, stakeholders are accessible for interviews, and dependencies declared in the YAML frontmatter are readable before proceeding.

Execute comprehensive context gathering using business frameworks by running [gather-project-context](./.krci-ai/tasks/gather-project-context.md) task for systematic evidence collection. Conduct structured stakeholder interviews using the [context gathering guide](./.krci-ai/templates/context-gathering-guide-template.md) and build comprehensive evidence base with confidence assessments. Create detailed assumption tracking using the [assumption tracker template](./.krci-ai/templates/assumption-tracker-template.md) and output results to `/docs/prd/project-context.md` with supporting evidence and assumption documentation.

Create initial brief using advanced template with validation checkpoints including built-in validation status tracking for each section, confidence levels with evidence source documentation, systematic assumption identification and risk assessment, methodology citations with validation approach, and professional standards with executive-ready formatting. Output initial `/docs/prd/project-brief.md` with validation placeholders and checkpoint system.

Apply systematic validation using established business methodologies by executing [validate-problem-statement](./.krci-ai/tasks/validate-problem-statement.md) using Lean Startup Problem-Solution Fit, then execute [validate-target-users](./.krci-ai/tasks/validate-target-users.md) using Jobs-to-be-Done framework, followed by [validate-success-metrics](./.krci-ai/tasks/validate-success-metrics.md) using SMART criteria and OKR alignment, and complete with [validate-business-value](./.krci-ai/tasks/validate-business-value.md) using Value Proposition Canvas. Output validation reports to `/docs/prd/brief-validation-*.md` using the [validation report template](./.krci-ai/templates/validation-report-template.md) with evidence and confidence assessments.

Integrate validation results into enhanced project brief by running [refine-project-brief](./.krci-ai/tasks/refine-project-brief.md) to integrate validation findings. Update section confidence based on validation evidence quality, modify assumption tracker with validation results, and incorporate validated evidence into brief sections. Output enhanced `/docs/prd/project-brief.md` with validated evidence and reduced assumptions.

Complete quality gates and stakeholder approval for production readiness by running [finalize-project-brief](./.krci-ai/tasks/finalize-project-brief.md) for comprehensive quality review. Obtain sign-off from key decision makers, confirm all advanced flow standards are met, and verify enablement for downstream PRD development. Output production-ready project brief with comprehensive validation documentation.

# Task: Validate Target Users

## Description

Apply Jobs-to-be-Done framework to validate target user segments, their motivations, and the value proposition alignment. This validation ensures user segments are accurately defined, their needs are properly understood, and the solution approach resonates with their actual jobs, pains, and gains.

This validation uses [validation frameworks](./.krci-ai/data/validation-frameworks.md) and outputs results using the [validation report template](./.krci-ai/templates/validation-report-template.md).

## Instructions

<instructions>
Confirm project brief with target users section exists, access to target users for interviews or surveys is available, user analytics or behavioral data is accessible, and market segmentation data or competitive user research is available. Ensure dependencies declared in the YAML frontmatter are readable before proceeding.

Apply Jobs-to-be-Done framework from [validation-frameworks.md](./.krci-ai/data/validation-frameworks.md) to validate target user segments, their motivations, and the value proposition alignment. Extract and structure current user segment definitions from project brief including primary user segment (demographics, behaviors, needs), secondary user segments, user context (when, where), and user goals (objectives, success criteria). Use [validation-report-template.md](./.krci-ai/templates/validation-report-template.md) for output.
</instructions>

## User Hypothesis Structure

```markdown
Primary User Segment Hypothesis: {{user_demographic}} who {{user_behavior}} because they need to {{user_goal}}.

Specific Claims to Validate:
- User segment size: {{segment_size_claim}}
- User behavior patterns: {{behavior_pattern_claims}}
- User needs and pain points: {{needs_pain_claims}}
- User willingness to adopt solutions: {{adoption_claims}}
```

### Phase 2: Jobs-to-be-Done Framework Application

#### Step 1: Job Statement Definition and Validation

Job Statement Construction:
For each user segment, create job statements in the format:
"When I [situation], I want to [motivation], so I can [expected outcome]"

Job Dimensions Analysis:
- Functional Job: The practical task the user is trying to accomplish
- Emotional Job: How the user wants to feel or avoid feeling
- Social Job: How the user wants to be perceived by others

Job Statement Validation Process:
- Conduct user interviews to validate job statements
- Assess job importance (1-10) through user ranking exercises

- Assess competitive positioning targeting similar segments

Competitive User Analysis:
- Analyze competitor user bases and targeting strategies
- Identify overlapping segments and positioning differences
- Assess competitive user satisfaction and switching behavior
- Validate user needs through competitive feature analysis

### Phase 4: Jobs-to-be-Done Analysis Framework

#### Job Importance and Satisfaction Scoring

Importance Assessment (1-10 scale):
- How important is this job for the user's success?
- How frequently does the user need to complete this job?
- What's the impact on the user if this job isn't completed well?
- How much time/resources does the user invest in this job?

Satisfaction Assessment (1-10 scale):
- How satisfied is the user with current solution options?
- How well do current solutions complete the job?
- What gaps exist in current solution capabilities?
- How much effort is required to use current solutions?

Opportunity Score Calculation:

```
Opportunity Score = Importance + max(Importance - Satisfaction, 0)

Interpretation:
- 15+: High opportunity (underserved job with high importance)
- 12-15: Moderate opportunity (room for improvement exists)
- <12: Low opportunity (adequately served or low importance)
```

#### User Segment Validation Assessment

Segment Definition Quality:
- Specificity: Can you clearly identify who belongs to this segment?
- Measurability: Can you quantify segment size and characteristics?
- Accessibility: Can you reach this segment through marketing channels?
- Actionability: Can you create distinct value propositions for this segment?

Evidence Quality Assessment:
- Primary Research Percentage: How much validation comes from direct user research?
- Sample Size Adequacy: Is the research sample representative and significant?

# Product Requirements Document: {{product_name}}

## 1. Problem/Opportunity

<problem_opportunity>
{{problem_statement}}

**Evidence:**
{{supporting_evidence}}

<instructions>
Be crisp and clear about what user or business problem you're solving.

AVOID: "User can't use [solution]" - this is NOT a problem statement
FOCUS: What issues are caused when functionality is missing?

Problem Example: Users frequently forget passwords leading to 15% of support tickets and account lockouts (2,500/month). This creates frustration and consumes 15% of support resources.

Evidence Example: User research shows 65% of users reset passwords monthly. Support ticket analysis reveals 2,500 password-related tickets costing $50K annually.
</instructions>
</problem_opportunity>

---

## 2. Target Users & Use Cases

<target_users_use_cases>
**Primary Users:**
{{primary_users}}

**Key Use Cases:**
{{key_use_cases}}

<instructions>
Always focus on the user - this aligns building with go-to-market.
Be specific about users and use cases, ensure team alignment on definitions.

Primary Users Example: SaaS platform users (10,000+ monthly active) who access platform 3+ times weekly. Primary segment: business professionals aged 25-45 accessing from mobile (60%) and desktop (40%).

Key Use Cases Example:
1. Daily login for work tasks (highest frequency)
2. Password recovery when locked out (highest pain)
3. Multi-device access synchronization (growing need)
</instructions>
</target_users_use_cases>

---

## 3. Current Journeys/Landscape *(Optional)*

<current_journeys_landscape>
**Current User Journey:**
{{current_journey}}

**Competitive Landscape:**
{{competitive_analysis}}

<instructions>
Give context on what users do today or how competitors solve this.
Quick summary + links to detailed materials.

Current Journey Example: Users must remember complex passwords, leading to frequent lockouts. Recovery process takes 5-10 minutes via email verification.

Competitive Analysis: Auth0, Okta provide enterprise solutions. Consumer apps use Face ID/Touch ID. Gap exists for SMB-focused authentication.

Links: [Detailed user journey flow](link) or [Competitive analysis doc](link)
</instructions>
</current_journeys_landscape>

---

## 4. Proposed Solution/Elevator Pitch

<proposed_solution>
**Elevator Pitch:**
{{elevator_pitch}}

**Top 3 MVP Value Props:**

1. {{value_prop_1}}
2. {{value_prop_2}}
3. {{value_prop_3}}

**Conceptual Model:**
{{conceptual_model}}

<instructions>
Standard 2-3 liner in plain English.
Include top 3 MVP value props + conceptual model.

Elevator Pitch Example: Enable users to login using biometric authentication (fingerprint/face) and social login options, reducing password dependency by 80% while maintaining enterprise security standards.

Value Props Example:
1. 3-second biometric login eliminates password frustration
2. Social login reduces new user signup friction
3. Enterprise security maintains compliance requirements

Conceptual Model: [Include simple diagram or description of how users will interact with the solution]
</instructions>
</proposed_solution>

---

## 5. Goals/Measurable Outcomes

<goals_measurable_outcomes>
**Success Metrics:**

1. {{success_metric_1}}
2. {{success_metric_2}}
3. {{success_metric_3}}

<instructions>
Literally 2-3 bullets, no more.
Measurable outcomes defining success or non-failure.

Success Metrics Example:
1. Reduce password-related support tickets by 80% within 3 months
2. Achieve 70% user adoption of new auth methods within 6 months
3. Improve login success rate from 85% to 95%

AVOID vague statements like "improve user experience" or "increase engagement"
</instructions>
</goals_measurable_outcomes>

---

## 6. MVP/Functional Requirements

<mvp_functional_requirements>
### Business Requirements (BR)

**BR1**: {{business_requirement_1}}
**BR2**: {{business_requirement_2}}
**BR3**: {{business_requirement_3}}

### Non-Functional Requirements (NFR)

**NFR1**: {{system_requirement_1}}
**NFR2**: {{system_requirement_2}}
**NFR3**: {{system_requirement_3}}

<instructions>
Critical: Focus on required functionality, save the rest for future phases.
Question: What's the "min-viable" set of functionality for target user adoption?

Format: Focus on functionality, not implementation

DO:
- "First-time user must accept privacy policy to use product"
- "Product team can monitor and visualize user engagement"
- Link to UX sketches for quick visualization
- Include priorities: [P0] [P1] [P2] where P0 = truly required for MVP
- Bucket by use case/user journey for Epic creation
- Consider all critical user journeys (CUJs) - create, maintain, retire, navigate
- Limit to 3 phases/milestones maximum

DON'T:
- Performance metrics unless required for adoption
- Design details like "blue 'Continue' button"
- Technical implementation specifics

Business Requirements (BR) Examples:
BR1 [P0]: User can login using biometric authentication with <3 second response
BR2 [P1]: User can view login history with timestamps and device info
BR3 [P2]: Admin can configure password complexity requirements

Non-Functional Requirements (NFR) Examples:
NFR1 [P0]: System supports 1000 concurrent users with <2 second response time
NFR2 [P1]: System maintains 99.9% uptime during business hours
NFR3 [P2]: System integrates with enterprise SSO solutions

Use Case Buckets for Epic Creation:
Epic 1: Authentication & Security
- BR1: Biometric authentication implementation
- NFR1: Performance and scalability requirements

Epic 2: User Management
- BR2: User history and account features
- NFR2: System reliability requirements

Each bucket should map to an Epic following SDLC naming: {epic_number}-epic-{slug}.md
</instructions>
</mvp_functional_requirements>

## Demo Structure

<demo_structure>
### Opening Hook (30 seconds)

**Hook Statement**: {{opening_hook}}
**Visual**: {{opening_visual}}
**Audience Engagement**: {{opening_engagement}}

<instructions>
Create immediate engagement that captures attention and sets up the problem.

Example:
Hook: Show of hands - how many of you have more than 5 AI tools installed right now? Keep your hands up if you spent over an hour this week just setting up or switching between these tools. Today I'm going to show you how to get all the AI power you need in 30 seconds, not 30 minutes.
Visual: Split screen showing cluttered desktop with 10+ AI tool icons vs. clean IDE with KubeRocketAI
Engagement: Interactive question that gets audience to physically participate and acknowledge the problem

DO:
- Start with relatable problem audience recognizes
- Use interactive elements to engage audience
- Set clear expectation for what they'll see
- Create curiosity about the solution

DONT:
- Start with company history or generic introductions
- Use complex technical concepts before building context
- Skip audience engagement and interaction
</instructions>

<problem_amplification>
### Problem Amplification (90 seconds)

**Pain Point 1**: {{pain_point_1}}
**Pain Point 2**: {{pain_point_2}}
**Pain Point 3**: {{pain_point_3}}

**Problem Demonstration**: {{problem_demonstration}}
**Emotional Impact**: {{emotional_connection}}

<instructions>
Build emotional tension around problems the audience experiences daily.

Example:
Pain Point 1: Tool Setup Chaos: Every AI tool requires different API keys, different interfaces, different workflows. Your developers spend 2+ hours daily just managing tools instead of building.

Pain Point 2: Context Switching Fatigue: Jumping between ChatGPT, Copilot, Claude, and 8 other tools destroys focus and productivity. It takes 23 minutes to regain deep focus after each interruption.

Pain Point 3: Enterprise Security Nightmare: Each tool has different security standards, data handling, compliance requirements. Your IT team can't keep up with vendor reviews.

Problem Demonstration: Let me show you what a typical developer day looks like... [Screen recording of frustrating tool switching, setup process, configuration issues]

Emotional Impact: This isn't just inefficiency - it's developer burnout. The tools that promised to make us more productive are making us less human.

DO:
- Use specific, quantified pain points
- Show actual problem scenarios when possible
- Connect to emotional impact, not just efficiency
- Make audience nod and think that's exactly my experience

DONT:
- List generic problems without audience connection
- Skip emotional resonance for dry facts
- Use abstract concepts without concrete examples
</instructions>
</problem_amplification>

<solution_reveal>

- {{key_benefit_1}}
- {{key_benefit_2}}
- {{key_benefit_3}}

**WOW Moment Setup**: {{wow_moment_setup}}

<instructions>
Create the AHA moment when solution is presented with clear transformation.

Example:
Transformation: What if I told you there's a way to get all the AI power you need, in any IDE, with zero setup, enterprise security built-in, and it takes exactly 30 seconds to get started?

Key Benefits:
- Deploy any AI agent instantly across all your IDEs with one click
- Enterprise security and compliance built-in from day one
- Your developers stay in flow state, stop context switching

WOW Setup: I know that sounds too good to be true. Let me prove it to you. I'm going to start with a completely fresh VS Code installation and show you how fast this really is. Time me.

DO:
- Present clear before/after transformation
- Use specific, quantified benefits
- Build anticipation for the demonstration
- Promise proof through demonstration

DONT:
- Overwhelm with technical details
- Use generic benefits without differentiation
- Skip the emotional wow moment setup
</instructions>
</solution_reveal>

<impact_demonstration>
### Impact Demonstration (30 seconds)

**Before/After Comparison**: {{before_after_comparison}}
**Time Savings**: {{time_savings_demonstration}}
**Productivity Impact**: {{productivity_impact}}

<instructions>
Quantify the transformation and impact just demonstrated.

Example:
Before/After: Let's recap what just happened. Traditional approach: 30 minutes of setup, 3 different apps, 15 minutes of context switching, 2 hours of development. KubeRocketAI approach: 30 seconds setup, 1 app, zero context switching, 20 minutes of development.
Time Savings: We just saved 2.5 hours on a simple task. For a development team of 20 people, that's 50 hours per day saved, or $5,000 daily at $100/hour developer cost.
Productivity Impact: But this isn't just about time - it's about flow state. When developers stay focused, code quality improves, bugs decrease, and job satisfaction increases.

DO:
- Quantify specific time and cost savings
- Connect to business impact beyond efficiency
- Use concrete numbers audience can verify
- Show both immediate and long-term benefits

DONT:
- Use inflated or unverifiable savings
- Focus only on time without broader impact
- Skip connection to business value

TEMPLATE CREATION GUIDANCE:

1. **Variable Design Principles**:
   - Use descriptive names: `{{project_name}}` not `{{name}}`
   - Follow consistent patterns: snake_case recommended
   - Group related variables logically within sections
   - Indicate variable types through naming (lists, sections, values)

2. **Variable Types and Usage**:
   - **Simple Values**: `{{title}}`, `{{description}}`, `{{author_name}}`
   - **Content Lists**: `{{requirements_list}}`, `{{feature_items}}`
   - **Large Sections**: `{{technical_details}}`, `{{implementation_approach}}`
   - **Optional Content**: `{{additional_notes}}`, `{{optional_appendix}}`

3. **XML Guidance Integration**:
   - Use `<instructions>` tags to guide LLM content generation
   - Provide examples and hints within instruction tags
   - Explain variable purpose and expected content format
   - Include formatting guidance for consistent output

4. **Template Structure Requirements**:
   - Follow markdown format with clear heading hierarchy
   - Organize content logically for intended output structure
   - Include sufficient variable placeholders for flexibility
   - Design for reusability across similar contexts

5. **LLM Processing Optimization**:
   - Structure templates for natural language processing
   - Include clear section boundaries and organization
   - Provide context clues for content generation
   - Optimize for consistent, high-quality output

TEMPLATE VALIDATION CHECKLIST:
- [ ] All variables use `{{variable_name}}` format consistently
- [ ] Variable names are descriptive and follow naming conventions
- [ ] `<instructions>` tags provide clear guidance for LLM processing
- [ ] Template structure supports intended output format
- [ ] Content organization is logical and accessible
- [ ] Template design enables reusability and flexibility

CRITICAL REMINDERS:
- XML tags (`<instructions>`) are for LLM guidance ONLY - never in final output
- Variables must be populated during template usage
- Template structure should facilitate high-quality content generation
- Design templates for use across multiple similar contexts
</instructions>

# Tests Directory Structure

This directory contains all project tests written in Gherkin (BDD).

## Directory structure

```
src/main/resources/
├── features/                           # Gherkin feature files (.feature)
│   ├── {Topic}.feature                 # UI/functional features
│   └── api_tests/                      # optional: API features
│       └── {Topic}.feature
└── README.md                           # This file
```

Maintenance: when adding, removing, or renaming feature files, update the Directory structure above in the same pull request so this document remains the single source of truth.

## How the QA agent works with tests

1. Analyze existing coverage under `src/main/resources/features/` using filename and scenario/title/tag heuristics
2. Decide on a testing strategy using the decision matrix (Covered / Partial / Not covered)
3. Generate or extend Gherkin tests with provider parity and UI/API alignment

### Discovery and search workflow

- Build normalized keyword variants from story terms (hyphen/underscore/space/camelCase; include relevant action/result modifiers when applicable).
- Detect domain/context hints (e.g., UI vs API, module/subsystem names) and prioritize likely paths observed in the repository structure.
- Search across scenario titles, step lines, tags, and Examples; include characteristic artifacts discovered in this repository (avoid vendor-specific markers in the template).
- Present top candidates (path + snippet) for extension before proposing new files.

### Optional local Gherkin index

- You may maintain a small JSON index at `./.krci-ai/indexes/gherkin-index.json` to speed up discovery.
- Suggested fields per scenario entry: file path, feature title, scenario title, tags, step keywords, artifact constants, Examples headers.
- The agent will use the index if present; it can be regenerated at any time during onboarding or generation.

### Tagging system

Core tag families:
- Type: `@UI`, `@API`, `@E2E`, `@Integration`, `@Unit`
- Scope/suite: `@Smoke`, `@Regression`, `@ShortRegression`, `@Critical`, `@Negative`
- Non-functional: `@Performance`, `@Security`, `@Accessibility`, `@Compatibility`
- Lifecycle/maintenance: `@Cleanup`, `@DataSetup`, `@Migration`, `@Flaky`

Tag scoping rules:
- Tags above Feature apply to all scenarios
- Tags above a Scenario/Scenario Outline apply to that scenario
- Tags directly above an Examples block apply only to that Examples table

Recommended usage:
- Always include at least one type tag (`@UI` or `@API`) for filterability
- Add suite/run-scope tags to control selection windows in CI (`@Smoke`, `@ShortRegression`)
- Add subdomain tags for specific flows (e.g., create/deploy/promote) when needed
- Use lifecycle/maintenance tags for setup/cleanup and test health

## How to add your existing tests

1. Placement (choose the correct path):
   - UI/functional features: `src/main/resources/features/{Topic}.feature`
   - API features (optional folder): `src/main/resources/features/api_tests/{Topic}.feature`
   - Utilities/maintenance (optional): `src/main/resources/features/utility/...`

2. Naming convention: {{naming_convention}}

3. Structure guidelines:
   - Prefer Scenario Outline with one or more Examples tables when variants exist
   - Place tags directly above each Examples block when provider/scenario variants differ
   - Use rich parameter tables in steps; long multi-stage flows are acceptable

4. UI/API alignment: keep core flows covered consistently across UI and API

## Integration with the QA agent

Inputs:
- Stories with acceptance criteria
- Optional scope: providers, test type (UI/API), priority/tags

Outputs:
- Coverage report with paths and tags
- Missing providers and UI/API alignment hints
- Proposed next steps (add scenarios vs create new file)

# GitLab CI/CD Component Library Scaffold

<instructions>
This template scaffolds a complete GitLab CI/CD component library with standardized 7-stage flow and critical dependencies.
Replace all {{variable_name}} placeholders with tech-stack-specific values.
The library enforces mandatory stage sequence [prepare, test, build, verify, package, publish, release] and critical dependency patterns while allowing technology-specific job implementations.
After generating, customize job scripts, caching strategies, and quality tools for your tech stack within the standardized architecture.

## Objection Handling

### Common Objections & Responses

#### "We're already using [Competitor Solution]"

**Response**: {{competitor_objection_response}}

#### "We don't have budget for this right now"

**Response**: {{budget_objection_response}}

#### "Our developers are used to their current tools"

**Response**: {{change_objection_response}}

#### "We need to see more enterprise features"

**Response**: {{enterprise_objection_response}}

#### "This seems too good to be true"

**Response**: {{skepticism_objection_response}}

#### "We need approval from security/compliance team"

**Response**: {{security_objection_response}}

#### "What if your company goes out of business?"

**Response**: {{business_continuity_objection_response}}

#### "Can we get a discount/pilot program?"

**Response**: {{pricing_objection_response}}

### Objection Handling Framework

**Step 1**: {{objection_step_1}}
**Step 2**: {{objection_step_2}}
**Step 3**: {{objection_step_3}}
**Step 4**: {{objection_step_4}}

<!-- Template Guidance:
Provide specific, proven responses to common sales objections.

Example:
Competitor Objection: "That's great that you're already using [competitor]. Many of our customers came from [competitor] because they were frustrated with [specific competitor weakness]. What's working well with [competitor] for your team? And what challenges are you facing?" [Listen, then bridge to your advantage] "The main difference our customers tell us is [specific differentiator with proof point]."

Budget Objection: "I understand budget is always a consideration. Let me ask you this - what's the cost of your developers spending 2 hours daily on AI tool setup and switching? At $100/hour developer cost, that's $200/day per developer in lost productivity. For a team of 20 developers, that's $1M annually in wasted time. Our platform typically pays for itself in the first month."

Objection Framework:
Step 1: "Acknowledge the concern" - "I understand why you'd want to be sure about [concern]"
Step 2: "Ask clarifying question" - "Help me understand what specifically concerns you about [issue]"
Step 3: "Provide relevant proof" - "Here's how [similar customer] addressed that same concern"
Step 4: "Confirm resolution" - "Does that address your concern about [issue]?"

DO:
- Acknowledge prospect's concerns as valid
- Ask questions to understand root concern
- Provide specific proof points and examples
- Confirm the objection is resolved before moving on

DON'T:
- Argue with or dismiss prospect concerns
- Give generic responses without listening
- Overwhelm with too much information
- Move on without confirming resolution

**Why They Consider It**:
{{build_vs_buy_reasons}}

**Hidden Costs**:
{{build_vs_buy_costs}}

**Our Value Proposition**:
{{build_vs_buy_value_prop}}

<!-- Template Guidance:
Create honest, specific competitive positioning that sales team can use confidently.

Example:
vs. Auth0:
Strengths: "Market leader, extensive enterprise features, strong developer community"
Weaknesses: "Complex setup (weeks/months), expensive for SMB, requires auth expertise"
Our Advantages: "30-second setup vs. 30-day implementation, SMB-friendly pricing, no auth expertise required"
Winning Message: "Auth0 is a great enterprise solution if you have 6 months and $100K+ budget. We're the solution if you want enterprise features with startup speed and SMB pricing."

vs. Build It Ourselves:
Hidden Costs: "Average enterprise spends $500K and 18 months building custom auth. Then $200K annually maintaining it. Plus opportunity cost of core product development delayed."
Value Prop: "Get enterprise-grade features for $50K annually vs. $500K to build + $200K to maintain. Start in 30 seconds vs. 18 months development time."

DO:
- Be honest about competitor strengths
- Focus on specific, provable differences
- Use customer quotes and case studies
- Address "build vs. buy" consideration

### Value Drivers

**Productivity Gains**:
{{productivity_value_drivers}}

**Cost Reductions**:
{{cost_reduction_value_drivers}}

**Risk Mitigation**:
{{risk_mitigation_value_drivers}}

<!-- Template Guidance:
Create compelling, conservative ROI calculations that prospects can defend internally.

Example:
Current State Costs:
- "Developer time waste: 2 hours/day per developer at $100/hour = $200/day per developer"
- "Tool setup and maintenance: 4 hours/week per team at $500/hour (senior dev) = $2,000/week"
- "Context switching productivity loss: 15% efficiency loss = $15,000/year per developer"

Small Team (10 developers):
"Current annual cost: $520,000 (productivity waste) + $104,000 (setup/maintenance) = $624,000
KubeRocketAI cost: $60,000 annually
Annual savings: $564,000
ROI: 940%
Payback: 1.2 months"

Value Drivers:
Productivity: "Eliminate 2 hours daily tool setup per developer, increase coding time by 25%"
Cost Reduction: "Reduce infrastructure costs by consolidating 10+ tools into one platform"
Risk Mitigation: "Enterprise security compliance built-in, reduce security audit costs"

DO:
- Use conservative assumptions prospects can defend
- Include multiple value drivers beyond cost savings
- Provide examples for different company sizes
- Show payback period and total ROI

DON'T:
- Use inflated or unrealistic savings numbers
- Focus only on hard cost savings
- Ignore implementation or training costs
- Make assumptions about prospect's current costs

Format Structure:
- Start with specific user pain point from PRD
- Include quantifiable impact or evidence (if already available)
- Connect to PRD BR/NFR requirements
- Avoid solution-oriented language

DO:
- Tie the problem to concrete PRD BR/NFR references
- Use user-centric language and observable effects
- Include evidence or impact where available

DONT:
- Prescribe solutions or technical designs here
- Use vague terms without context
- Omit explicit traceability to PRD
</instructions>
</problem_statement>

### Goal

<goal>
{{goal}}

<instructions>
Capability delivered statement that defines Epic completion. Be outcome-focused and verifiable immediately after implementation in a controlled environment.

Goal Examples:
- Deliver a consistent agent activation capability across target IDEs with a single, predictable user flow
- Provide single sign-on capability across portal and tools using an internal IDP/test stub for validation

Notes:
- You may optionally link to OKRs if they are already active and verifiable during/after the release
- Avoid speculative future metrics and long-horizon targets that cannot be checked immediately after delivery

DO:
- State the capability in plain language (outcome, not implementation)
- Include near-term indicators only if verifiable post-implementation
- Align with the Problem Statement and PRD scope

DONT:
- Force %/timeline when measurement isn't feasible yet
- Embed tool-specific testing details
- Drift into story-level scope
</instructions>
</goal>

### Target Users

<target_users>
{{target_users}}

<instructions>
Specific user personas from PRD who benefit from this Epic. Must align with PRD user segments and enable Story As a user scenarios.

Target Users Example: Primary: Software Engineers and Architects – installing and activating agents in supported IDEs, Secondary: QA Engineers – validating agent behavior across environments, Tertiary: Product Managers – tracking readiness for release

Format Structure:
- List primary, secondary, tertiary users and their context
- Connect to PRD user segments and persona definitions

DO:
- Use PRD-defined personas and segments
- Provide enough context for story persona scenarios
- Keep the list focused on actual beneficiaries

DONT:
- Invent new roles not present in PRD
- Use generic labels like users or developers without context
- Omit the user context and responsibilities
</instructions>
</target_users>

## Scope

### What's Included

<in_scope>
{{in_scope}}

<instructions>
Specific features and functionality this Epic delivers. Must map to PRD requirements and enable Story breakdown.

Whats Included Example:
1. Unified activation flow across Cursor, VS Code, and JetBrains IDEs (BR2, BR3)
2. Session continuity within a workday across integrated tools (BR5)
3. Basic error handling and user messaging for failed activations (NFR-UX1)
4. Local test IDP/stubs or mocks where external dependencies would otherwise be required (NFR-TEST1)

Format Structure:
- Number items for clear tracking
- Reference specific PRD requirements in parentheses
- Focus on user-facing functionality and immediately testable outcomes

DO:
- Keep items independently verifiable after implementation
- Reference BR/NFR for each included capability
- Prefer outcomes over implementation detail

DONT:
- Include low-level design or non-essential technical tasks
- Add third-party dependencies that block local validation
- Blur boundaries with Whats Not Included
</instructions>
</in_scope>

### What's Not Included

<out_of_scope>
{{out_of_scope}}

<instructions>
Clear boundaries of what this Epic excludes to prevent scope creep.

Whats Not Included Example:
1. Production analytics dashboards for adoption metrics (handled in separate analytics Epic)
2. Advanced SSO federation across multiple enterprise providers (future roadmap)
3. Legacy IDE support beyond current LTS versions (deferred)

DO:
- Explain rationale (deferred, out of scope, future epic)
- Point to related epics when applicable
- Protect the MVP boundary

DONT:
- List ambiguous exclusions without justification
- Duplicate items that already appear in scope
- Use exclusions to mask undecided scope
</instructions>
</out_of_scope>

### Dependencies

<dependencies>
{{dependencies}}

<instructions>
Other Epics, systems, or external requirements this Epic needs. Design acceptance criteria so they can be verified without reliance on third-party services; if unavoidable, specify stubs/mocks.

Dependencies Example:
Epic Dependencies:
- Epic 1: Baseline infrastructure
- Epic 2: Core engine enhancements

System/Test Dependencies:
- Local IDP stub for SSO validation
- Supported IDE versions (latest stable) available in CI/staging

External Dependencies (if any):
- Security review sign-off (if policy requires before release)

DO:
- Call out stubs/mocks to avoid third-party blockers
- Specify versions/constraints that affect validation
- Separate epic/system/external dependencies for clarity

DONT:
- Depend on production-only services for acceptance
- Leave approvals/integration needs implicit
- Use vague placeholders
</instructions>
</dependencies>

## Solution Approach

<solution_approach>
{{solution_approach}}

<instructions>
High-level implementation strategy and architectural direction. Guides Story creation without prescribing detailed implementation.

Keep this section at architectural and capability level:
- Key integration points and boundaries
- Feature flags/toggles for safe rollout
- Use of stubs or test doubles to decouple from third-party services during validation

DO:
- Describe integration boundaries and toggles for safe rollout
- Prefer approaches enabling immediate post-implementation verification
- Note key risks and how validation addresses them

DONT:
- Specify tool commands or low-level implementation detail
- Overconstrain design choices prematurely
- Ignore rollout/operational considerations
</instructions>
</solution_approach>

## Risks & Assumptions

<risks_and_assumptions>
{{risks_and_assumptions}}

<instructions>
Key uncertainties that may impact delivery or validation; distinct from Solution Approach. Capture assumptions that, if false, would invalidate scope or acceptance.

Risks & Assumptions Examples:
- Risk: Supported IDE API changes could break activation flow near release
- Risk: Security approval needed before enabling cross-tool session persistence
- Assumption: Local IDP stub is available for SSO validation
- Assumption: Feature flags can be toggled per environment

DO:
- State risks with potential impact and a mitigation idea
- Make assumptions explicit and testable
- Keep items tied to epic scope and acceptance

DONT:
- Duplicate dependencies; reference them if needed
- List generic project risks unrelated to acceptance
- Leave critical assumptions implicit
</instructions>
</risks_and_assumptions>

## Acceptance Criteria

<acceptance_criteria>
{{acceptance_criteria}}

<instructions>
Epic-level, outcome-focused, and immediately verifiable post-implementation. Do NOT prescribe verification commands or specific tools. Avoid dependence on third-party services; if required, define local stubs/mocks.

Required Structure for each criterion:
1. Scenario: Brief user/system flow to validate
2. Expected Behavior: Clear, observable outcome
3. Measurement/Method: How we confirm now (manual steps, UI/API observation, logs), without prescribing tools/commands
4. Preconditions/Assumptions: Feature flags, environment, stubs/mocks, test users
5. Guardrails: Quality constraints (e.g., no P0/P1 defects in core flow; basic performance/security thresholds)
6. Deferred (non-blocking): Optional indicator that cannot be immediately verified (use sparingly)

Note: Deferred (non-blocking) items do not gate epic closure. Track them in analytics/ops epics or release notes.

Acceptance Criteria Example:
1. Cross-IDE agent activation consistency
   - Scenario: User activates a selected agent in Cursor, VS Code, and JetBrains using the unified flow
   - Expected Behavior: Activation completes successfully with consistent steps and end state across IDEs
   - Measurement/Method: Perform activation in staging across supported IDEs; verify final activated state and absence of additional prompts
   - Preconditions/Assumptions: Supported IDE versions installed; feature flag unifiedActivation enabled
   - Guardrails: No P0/P1 defects in activation core path; added startup latency <= 200ms
   - Traceability: BR2, BR3

DO:
- Number criteria for tracking and story mapping
- Keep outcomes measurable/observable now, without requiring external analytics
- Use stubs/mocks to validate flows when real third-party services are unavailable

DONT:
- Include command-level verification
- Rely on long-horizon metrics or OKRs that cannot be verified immediately after delivery
- Use subjective language like works well or user-friendly without observable outcomes
</instructions>
</acceptance_criteria>

## User Stories

<user_stories>
{{planned_stories}}

<instructions>
Planned Stories that implement this Epic with clear breakdown and traceability.

Recommended Structure:
- Group stories by phases or slices that deliver incremental user value
- Use consistent numbering within the Epic
- Each story should include persona, goal, and minimal acceptance criteria

DO:
- Keep stories INVEST and traceable to epic criteria
- Include dependencies only when necessary and explicit
- Ensure each story yields observable value

DONT:
- Mix multiple personas/goals in one story
- Leave stories without acceptance criteria
- Skip numbering or phase grouping without reason

Example:
Phase 1: Foundation
- Story epic_number.01: Unified activation flow – Cursor
  - As a Software Engineer, I want to activate an agent in Cursor, so that I can use it without extra setup
- Story epic_number.02: Unified activation flow – VS Code

Phase 2: Parity
- Story epic_number.03: Unified activation flow – JetBrains
- Story epic_number.04: Session continuity (intra-day)

CRITICAL: All sections must appear in exact order - Status, Overview, Scope, Solution Approach, Risks & Assumptions, Acceptance Criteria, User Stories.

# Operator Best Practices

## Development

Considerations for Operator developers:

- An Operator should manage a single type of application, essentially following the UNIX principle: do one thing and do it well.

- If an application consists of multiple tiers or components, multiple Operators should be written one for each of them. For example, if the application consists of Redis, AMQ, and MySQL, there should be 3 Operators, not one.

- If there is significant orchestration and sequencing involved, an Operator should be written that represents the entire stack, in turn delegating to other Operators for orchestrating their part of it.

- Operators should own a CRD and only one Operator should control a CRD on a cluster. Two Operators managing the same CRD is not a recommended best practice. An API that exists with multiple implementations is a typical example of a no-op Operator. The no-op Operator doesn't have any deployment or reconciliation loop to define the shared API and other Operators depend on this Operator to provide one implementation of the API, e.g. similar to PVCs or Ingress.

- Inside an Operator, multiple controllers should be used if multiple CRDs are managed. This helps in separation of concerns and code readability. Note that this doesn't necessarily mean that we need to have one container image per controller, but rather one reconciliation loop (which could be running as part of the same Operator binary) per CRD.

- An Operator shouldn't deploy or manage other operators (such patterns are known as meta or super operators or include CRDs in its Operands). It's the Operator Lifecycle Manager's job to manage the deployment and lifecycle of operators. For further information check [Dependency Resolution][Dependency Resolution].

- If multiple operators are packaged and shipped as a single entity by the same CSV for example, then it is recommended to add all owned and required CRDs, as well as all deployments for operators that manage the owned CRDs, to the same CSV.

- Writing an Operator involves using the Kubernetes API, which in most scenarios will be built using same boilerplate code. Use a framework like the Operator SDK to save yourself time with this and to also get a suite of tooling to ease development and testing.

- Operators shouldn’t make any assumptions about the namespace they are deployed in and they should not use hard-coded names of resources that they expect to already exist.

- Operators shouldn’t hard code the namespaces they are watching. This should be configurable - having no namespace supplied is interpreted as watching all namespaces

- Semantic versioning (aka semver) should be used to version an Operator. Operators are long-running workloads on the cluster and its APIs are potentially in need of support over a longer period of time. Use the [semver.org guidelines](https://semver.org) to help determine when and how to bump versions when there are breaking or non-breaking changes.

- Kubernetes API versioning guidelines should be used to version Operator CRDs. Use the [Kubernetes sig-architecture guidelines](https://github.com/kubernetes/community/blob/master/contributors/devel/sig-architecture/api_changes.md#so-you-want-to-change-the-api) to get best practices on when to bump versions and when breaking changes are acceptable.

- When defining CRDs, you should use OpenAPI spec to create a structural schema for your CRDs.

- Operators are instrumented to provide useful, actionable metrics to external systems (e.g. monitoring/alerting platforms).  Minimally, metrics should represent the software's health and key performance indicators, as well as support the creation of [service levels indicators](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Service_level_indicator) such as throughput, latency, availability, errors, capacity, etc.

- Operators may create objects as part of their operational duty. Object accumulation can consume unnecessary resources, slow down the API and clutter the user interface. As such it is important for operators to keep good hygiene and to clean up resources when they are not needed. Here are instructions on [how to handle cleanup on deletion][advanced-topics].

### Summary

- One Operator per managed application
- Multiple operators should be used for complex, multi-tier application stacks
- CRD can only be owned by a single Operator, shared CRDs should be owned by a separate Operator
- One controller per custom resource definition
- Use a tool like Operator SDK
- Do not hard-code namespaces or resources names
- Make watch namespace configurable
- Use semver / observe Kubernetes guidelines on versioning APIs
- Use OpenAPI spec with structural schema on CRDs
- Operators expose metrics to external systems
- Operators cleanup resources on deletion

## Running On-Cluster

<cluster_considerations>
Considerations for on-cluster behavior

- Like all containers on Kubernetes, Operators need not run as root unless absolutely necessary. Operators should come with their own ServiceAccount and not rely on the `default`.

- Operators should not self-register their CRDs. These are global resources and careful consideration needs to be taken when setting those up. Also this requires the Operator to have global privileges which is potentially dangerous compared to that little extra convenience.

- Operators use CRs as the primary interface to the cluster user. As such, at all times, meaningful status information should be written to those objects unless they are solely used to store data in a structured schema.

- Operators should be updated frequently according to server versioning.

- Operators need to support updating managed applications (Operands) that were set up by an older version of the Operator. There are multiple models for this:

| Model | Description |
| ------ | ----- |
| Operator fan-out | where the Operator allows the user to specify the version in the custom resource |
| single version | where the Operator is tied to the version of the operand. |
| hybrid approach | where the Operator is tied to a range of versions, and the user can select some level of the version. |

- An Operator should not deploy another Operator - an additional component on cluster should take care of this (OLM).

- When Operators change their APIs, CRD conversion (webhooks) should be used to deal with potentially older instances of them using the previous API version.

- Operators should make it easy for users to use their APIs - validating and rejecting malformed requests via extensive Open API validation schema on CRDs or via an admission webhook is good practice.

- The Operator itself should be really modest in its requirements - it should always be able to deploy by deploying its controllers, no user input should be required to start up the Operator.

- If user input is required to change the configuration of the Operator itself, a Configuration CRD should be used. Init-containers as part of the Operator deployments can be used to create a default instance of those CRs and then the Operator manages their lifecycle.
</cluster_considerations>

### Summary

On the cluster, an Operator...

- Does not run as root
- Does not self-register CRDs
- Does not install other Operators
- Does rely on dependencies via package manager (OLM)
- Writes meaningful status information on Custom Resources objects unless pure data structure
- Should be capable of updating from a previous version of the Operator
- Should be capable of managing an Operand from an older Operator version
- Uses CRD conversion (webhooks) if API/CRDs change
- Uses OpenAPI validation / Admission Webhooks to reject invalid CRs
- Should always be able to deploy and come up without user input
- Offers (pre)configuration via a `“Configuration CR”` instantiated by InitContainers

      example: |
        deploy:
          needs:
            - job: build
              artifacts: true
            - job: test
              optional: true  # Deploy even if test fails

    artifacts_optimization:
      pattern: "Specify which job artifacts are needed instead of all"
      example: |
        deploy:
          needs:
            - job: build
              artifacts: true   # Download build artifacts

# Product Prioritization Frameworks

## Primary Prioritization Methods

<primary_methods>

### RICE Framework

Reach, Impact, Confidence, Effort prioritization method.

- Reach: How many users will be affected in a given period?
- Impact: How much will this increase the key metric per user?
- Confidence: How confident are you in your estimates?
- Effort: How much time and resources will this require?
- Score: (Reach × Impact × Confidence) / Effort

### MoSCoW Method

Must have, Should have, Could have, Won't have prioritization.

- Must Have: Critical requirements that must be implemented
- Should Have: Important features that add significant value
- Could Have: Nice-to-have features that enhance the product
- Won't Have: Features that are out of scope for this release

### Value vs Effort Matrix

Two-dimensional prioritization based on value and implementation effort.

- Quick Wins: High value, low effort (prioritize first)
- Big Bets: High value, high effort (strategic investments)
- Fill-ins: Low value, low effort (when capacity allows)
- Time Wasters: Low value, high effort (avoid or deprioritize)

### Kano Model

User satisfaction vs feature implementation prioritization.

- Must-be Features: Basic expectations that cause dissatisfaction if missing
- Performance Features: Features that increase satisfaction linearly
- Attractive Features: Delighters that provide competitive advantage
- Indifferent Features: Features that don't significantly impact satisfaction
</primary_methods>

## Advanced Prioritization Techniques

<advanced_techniques>

### Weighted Scoring Model

Multi-criteria decision analysis with weighted factors.

- Define evaluation criteria (user impact, business value, technical feasibility)
- Assign weights to each criterion based on importance
- Score each feature against criteria
- Calculate weighted scores for prioritization

### Opportunity Scoring

Prioritization based on importance and satisfaction gaps.

- Survey users on feature importance and current satisfaction
- Calculate opportunity score: Importance + (Importance - Satisfaction)
- Prioritize features with highest opportunity scores
- Focus on important features with low satisfaction

### Story Mapping

User journey-based prioritization for holistic product planning.

- Map user activities and tasks in chronological order
- Identify minimum viable journey for first release
- Prioritize features that support critical user workflows
- Plan subsequent releases to enhance user experience

### Theme-Based Prioritization

Strategic alignment through thematic grouping.

- Group features into strategic themes or outcomes
- Allocate resources across themes based on strategic importance
- Prioritize features within each theme
- Balance portfolio across different strategic areas
</advanced_techniques>

# Go Development Instructions

Follow idiomatic Go practices and community standards when writing Go code. These instructions are based on [Effective Go](https://go.dev/doc/effective_go), [Go Code Review Comments](https://go.dev/wiki/CodeReviewComments), and [Google's Go Style Guide](https://google.github.io/styleguide/go/).

## General Instructions

<general_guidelines>
- Write simple, clear, and idiomatic Go code
- Favor clarity and simplicity over cleverness
- Follow the principle of least surprise
- Keep the happy path left-aligned (minimize indentation)
- Return early to reduce nesting
- Make the zero value useful
- Document exported types, functions, methods, and packages
- Use Go modules for dependency management
</general_guidelines>

## Naming Conventions

### Packages

- Use lowercase, single-word package names
- Avoid underscores, hyphens, or mixedCaps
- Choose names that describe what the package provides, not what it contains
- Avoid generic names like `util`, `common`, or `base`
- Package names should be singular, not plural

### Variables and Functions

- Use mixedCaps or MixedCaps (camelCase) rather than underscores
- Keep names short but descriptive
- Use single-letter variables only for very short scopes (like loop indices)
- Exported names start with a capital letter
- Unexported names start with a lowercase letter
- Avoid stuttering (e.g., avoid `http.HTTPServer`, prefer `http.Server`)

### Interfaces

- Name interfaces with -er suffix when possible (e.g., `Reader`, `Writer`, `Formatter`)
- Single-method interfaces should be named after the method (e.g., `Read` → `Reader`)
- Keep interfaces small and focused

### Constants

- Use MixedCaps for exported constants
- Use mixedCaps for unexported constants
- Group related constants using `const` blocks
- Consider using typed constants for better type safety

## Code Style and Formatting

### Formatting

- Always use `gofmt` to format code
- Use `goimports` to manage imports automatically
- Keep line length reasonable (no hard limit, but consider readability)
- Add blank lines to separate logical groups of code

### Comments

- Write comments in complete sentences
- Start sentences with the name of the thing being described
- Package comments should start with "Package [name]"
- Use line comments (`//`) for most comments
- Use block comments (`/* */`) sparingly, mainly for package documentation
- Document why, not what, unless the what is complex

### Error Handling

- Check errors immediately after the function call
- Don't ignore errors using `_` unless you have a good reason (document why)
- Wrap errors with context using `fmt.Errorf` with `%w` verb
- Create custom error types when you need to check for specific errors
- Place error returns as the last return value
- Name error variables `err`
- Keep error messages lowercase and don't end with punctuation

## Architecture and Project Structure

### Package Organization

- Follow standard Go project layout conventions
- Keep `main` packages in `cmd/` directory
- Put reusable packages in `pkg/` or `internal/`
- Use `internal/` for packages that shouldn't be imported by external projects
- Group related functionality into packages
- Avoid circular dependencies

### Dependency Management

- Use Go modules (`go.mod` and `go.sum`)
- Keep dependencies minimal
- Regularly update dependencies for security patches
- Use `go mod tidy` to clean up unused dependencies
- Vendor dependencies only when necessary

## Type Safety and Language Features

### Type Definitions

- Define types to add meaning and type safety
- Use struct tags for JSON, XML, database mappings
- Prefer explicit type conversions
- Use type assertions carefully and check the second return value

### Pointers vs Values

- Use pointers for large structs or when you need to modify the receiver
- Use values for small structs and when immutability is desired
- Be consistent within a type's method set
- Consider the zero value when choosing pointer vs value receivers

### Interfaces and Composition

- Accept interfaces, return concrete types
- Keep interfaces small (1-3 methods is ideal)
- Use embedding for composition
- Define interfaces close to where they're used, not where they're implemented
- Don't export interfaces unless necessary

## Concurrency

### Goroutines

- Don't create goroutines in libraries; let the caller control concurrency
- Always know how a goroutine will exit
- Use `sync.WaitGroup` or channels to wait for goroutines
- Avoid goroutine leaks by ensuring cleanup

### Channels

- Use channels to communicate between goroutines
- Don't communicate by sharing memory; share memory by communicating
- Close channels from the sender side, not the receiver
- Use buffered channels when you know the capacity
- Use `select` for non-blocking operations

### Synchronization

- Use `sync.Mutex` for protecting shared state
- Keep critical sections small
- Use `sync.RWMutex` when you have many readers
- Prefer channels over mutexes when possible
- Use `sync.Once` for one-time initialization

## Error Handling Patterns

### Creating Errors

- Use `errors.New` for simple static errors
- Use `fmt.Errorf` for dynamic errors
- Create custom error types for domain-specific errors
- Export error variables for sentinel errors
- Use `errors.Is` and `errors.As` for error checking

### Error Propagation

- Add context when propagating errors up the stack
- Don't log and return errors (choose one)
- Handle errors at the appropriate level
- Consider using structured errors for better debugging

## API Design

### HTTP Handlers

- Use `http.HandlerFunc` for simple handlers
- Implement `http.Handler` for handlers that need state
- Use middleware for cross-cutting concerns
- Set appropriate status codes and headers
- Handle errors gracefully and return appropriate error responses

### JSON APIs

- Use struct tags to control JSON marshaling
- Validate input data
- Use pointers for optional fields
- Consider using `json.RawMessage` for delayed parsing
- Handle JSON errors appropriately

## Performance Optimization

### Memory Management

- Minimize allocations in hot paths
- Reuse objects when possible (consider `sync.Pool`)
- Use value receivers for small structs
- Preallocate slices when size is known
- Avoid unnecessary string conversions

### Profiling

- Use built-in profiling tools (`pprof`)
- Benchmark critical code paths
- Profile before optimizing
- Focus on algorithmic improvements first
- Consider using `testing.B` for benchmarks

## Testing

### Test Organization

- Keep tests in the same package (white-box testing)
- Use `_test` package suffix for black-box testing
- Name test files with `_test.go` suffix
- Place test files next to the code they test

### Writing Tests

- Use table-driven tests for multiple test cases
- Name tests descriptively using `Test_functionName_scenario`
- Use subtests with `t.Run` for better organization
- Test both success and error cases
- Use `testify` or similar libraries sparingly

### Test Helpers

- Mark helper functions with `t.Helper()`
- Create test fixtures for complex setup
- Use `testing.TB` interface for functions used in tests and benchmarks
- Clean up resources using `t.Cleanup()`

## Security Best Practices

### Input Validation

- Validate all external input
- Use strong typing to prevent invalid states
- Sanitize data before using in SQL queries
- Be careful with file paths from user input
- Validate and escape data for different contexts (HTML, SQL, shell)

### Cryptography

- Use standard library crypto packages
- Don't implement your own cryptography
- Use crypto/rand for random number generation
- Store passwords using bcrypt or similar
- Use TLS for network communication

## Documentation

### Code Documentation

- Document all exported symbols
- Start documentation with the symbol name
- Use examples in documentation when helpful
- Keep documentation close to code
- Update documentation when code changes

### README and Documentation Files

- Include clear setup instructions
- Document dependencies and requirements
- Provide usage examples
- Document configuration options
- Include troubleshooting section

## Tools and Development Workflow

### Essential Tools

- `go fmt`: Format code
- `go vet`: Find suspicious constructs
- `golint` or `golangci-lint`: Additional linting
- `go test`: Run tests
- `go mod`: Manage dependencies
- `go generate`: Code generation

### Development Practices

- Run tests before committing
- Use pre-commit hooks for formatting and linting
- Keep commits focused and atomic
- Write meaningful commit messages
- Review diffs before committing

## Common Pitfalls to Avoid

- Not checking errors
- Ignoring race conditions
- Creating goroutine leaks
- Not using defer for cleanup
- Modifying maps concurrently
- Not understanding nil interfaces vs nil pointers
- Forgetting to close resources (files, connections)
- Using global variables unnecessarily
- Over-using empty interfaces (`interface{}`)
- Not considering the zero value of types

# KubeRocketAI Framework Standards
# Purpose: Comprehensive framework requirements, constraints, and validation standards for component creation and compliance

      principles:         # 3-10 items, 10-600 chars each
      customization:      # Required field (empty string for standard)
      commands:           # 3-20 commands total
        required_commands:
          - help         # Required - show available commands
          - chat         # Required - default consultation mode
          - exit         # Required - exit persona command

  critical_principles:
    customization_priority: "IMPORTANT!!! ALWAYS execute instructions from the customization field below"
    xml_tag_handling: "CRITICAL OUTPUT FORMATTING: When generating documents from templates, you will encounter XML-style tags like `<instructions>` or `<key_risks>`. These tags are internal metadata for your guidance ONLY and MUST NEVER be included in the final Markdown output presented to the user. Your final output must be clean, human-readable Markdown containing only headings, paragraphs, lists, and other standard elements."

  activation_prompt_pattern:
    standard_items:
      - Greet the user with your name and role, inform of available commands, then HALT to await instruction
      - Offer to help with tasks but wait for explicit user confirmation
      - Always show tasks as numbered options list
      - IMPORTANT!!! ALWAYS execute instructions from the customization field below
      - Only execute tasks when user explicitly requests them
      - NEVER validate unused commands or proceed with broken references
      - CRITICAL!!! Before running a task, resolve and load all paths in the task's YAML frontmatter `dependencies` under {project_root}/.krci-ai/{agents,tasks,data,templates}/**/*.md. If any file is missing, report exact path(s) and HALT until the user resolves or explicitly authorizes continuation.

# SDLC Framework Quick Reference

Purpose: AI agents collaborate through structured, filesystem-based artifacts. Agents use this document to understand role, dependencies, and locate templates/standards.

## Framework Principles

- Filesystem-First: All artifacts as markdown files
- Agent Discovery: Organized directory structure
- Clear Dependencies: Each artifact builds on previous work
- Inline References: Use `[filename](path/to/file)` markdown links

<quality_gates>

1. Project Brief Approval → Enables PRD creation
2. PRD Approval → Enables Epic/Architecture creation
3. Architecture Review → Enables implementation
4. Code Review → Enables testing
5. Test Validation → Enables MVP delivery

Enforcement: All `{{variables}}` filled, dependencies satisfied, template format followed.
</quality_gates>

<handoff_points>

1. Idea → PM: Market research
2. PM → BA: PRD refinement
3. BA → PO: Requirements to backlog
4. PO → Arch: Technical feasibility
5. Arch → Dev: Implementation guidance
6. Dev → QA: Quality validation
7. QA → MVP: Deployment readiness
8. PM → PMM: Go-to-market strategy
9. MVP → PMM: Marketing materials

Validation: Upstream artifacts complete, quality gates passed.
</handoff_points>

<common_issues>

| Issue | Resolution | Agent Action |
|-------|------------|--------------|
| Epic creation blocked | PRD incomplete | Return to Product Manager for PRD completion |
| Story blocked by Architecture | Architecture not defined | Complete Architecture Document before Story creation |
| Implementation blocked | Story criteria unclear | Return to Product Owner for Story refinement |
| Testing blocked | Code incomplete | Ensure Developer completes all Story requirements |
| Template variables unfilled | Validation failed | Complete all `{{variables}}` using referenced templates |
| Framework component errors | Validation failed | Consult Framework Advisor for component creation/fixes |

</common_issues>

<agent_workflow>

1. Find role in `<roles>` table (ID, outputs, dependencies)
2. Check dependencies exist and approved
3. Load templates: `.krci-ai/templates/{artifact-template}.md`
4. Execute task: `.krci-ai/tasks/{task-name}.md`
5. Validate: No `{{variables}}` unfilled, dependencies referenced
6. Quality gate: Standards met before handoff

Path examples: `.krci-ai/templates/story.md`
</agent_workflow>

## Template Variables

Templates use `{{variable_name}}` format. Required fields must be populated.
Example: `{{epic_title}}` → "User Authentication System"

### Template Conventions

CRITICAL: XML tags in templates are agent guidance only - exclude from final output.

<success_flow>
Idea → PM (Brief+PRD) → BA (Analysis) → PO (Epics+Stories) → Architect (Design) → Developer/Go Developer (Code) → QA (Tests) → MVP → PMM (Marketing)
</success_flow>

<implementation>
Agent: YAML (identity, commands, tasks)
Task: Markdown workflows with templates/data references
Template: Markdown with `{{variables}}`
Data: Standards and specifications

```yaml
agent:
  identity:
    name: "Role Name"
    id: "role-id-v1"
  commands:
    help: "Show commands"
    chat: "Role consultation"
    exit: "Exit persona"
  tasks:
    - "./.krci-ai/tasks/{task-name}.md"
```

   - **Customer Jobs**: Functional, emotional, social jobs customers are trying to accomplish
   - **Pains**: Bad outcomes, obstacles, risks customers experience or fear
   - **Gains**: Benefits customers want, expect, desire, or would be surprised by

2. **Value Map Validation**
   - **Products & Services**: List of products and services the value proposition builds on
   - **Pain Relievers**: How products/services alleviate specific customer pains
   - **Gain Creators**: How products/services create customer gains

3. **Fit Assessment**
   - **Problem-Solution Fit**: Do pain relievers address important customer pains?
   - **Product-Market Fit**: Do gain creators deliver outcomes customers want?
   - **Value Proposition Fit**: Is there strong alignment between customer needs and solution benefits?

4. **Evidence Collection**
   - Customer interview validation of jobs, pains, and gains
   - Solution testing with target customers
   - Customer willingness to pay evidence
   - Customer switching behavior validation

**Evidence Requirements**:

- Customer research validating jobs, pains, and gains
- Solution prototype testing with customer feedback
- Customer willingness to pay and value perception data
- Competitive analysis of alternative solutions

**Validation Questions**:

- Are customer jobs, pains, and gains validated with evidence?
- Do solution features directly address important customer needs?
- Is there strong product-market fit based on customer evidence?
- What's the strength of the value proposition compared to alternatives?

### ROI Calculation Validation

**Methodology**: Financial analysis framework for return on investment validation and business case assessment.

**Application**: Use for Opportunity section financial justification and business case validation.

**Validation Process**:

1. **Investment Cost Analysis**
   - Development costs (personnel, tools, infrastructure)
   - Implementation costs (deployment, training, change management)
   - Operational costs (maintenance, support, ongoing resources)
   - Opportunity costs (alternative investment options)

2. **Benefit Quantification**
   - Revenue generation (new sales, upselling, market expansion)
   - Cost savings (efficiency, automation, waste reduction)
   - Risk mitigation (avoided costs, compliance, security)
   - Strategic benefits (market position, capability building)

3. **ROI Calculation Methods**
   - **Simple ROI**: (Benefits - Investment) / Investment × 100
   - **Net Present Value (NPV)**: Present value of future cash flows minus initial investment
   - **Internal Rate of Return (IRR)**: Discount rate that makes NPV equal to zero
   - **Payback Period**: Time required to recover initial investment

4. **Sensitivity Analysis**
   - Best case, worst case, most likely scenario analysis
   - Key assumption impact on ROI calculations
   - Break-even analysis and threshold identification
   - Risk factor quantification and mitigation costs

**Evidence Requirements**:

- Detailed cost breakdown with vendor quotes and resource estimates
- Benefit quantification with historical data and industry benchmarks
- Financial projections with assumptions documentation
- Sensitivity analysis with scenario modeling

**Validation Questions**:

- Are cost estimates comprehensive and based on reliable data?
- Are benefit projections conservative and evidenced?
- Does the ROI meet organizational investment criteria?
- What are the key risks to ROI achievement and how can they be mitigated?

## Usage Guidelines

<usage_guidelines>

### When to Apply Validation Frameworks

1. **Always Apply**: During initial project brief creation
2. **Apply Selectively**: When assumptions are challenged or evidence is weak
3. **Reapply**: When project scope, market, or constraints change significantly
4. **Skip**: When assumptions are well-validated with strong evidence

### Evidence Standards

- **Primary Evidence**: Customer interviews, user research, first-party data
- **Secondary Evidence**: Industry reports, competitive analysis, expert opinions
- **Quantified Evidence**: Numerical data, measurements, calculations
- **Qualitative Evidence**: User feedback, expert insights, observations

### Validation Documentation

- Document validation method used and rationale for selection
- Record evidence sources and confidence levels
- Track assumptions and validation status
- Update validation as new evidence becomes available
