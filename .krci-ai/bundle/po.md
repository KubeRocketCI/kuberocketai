# Task: Create Epic

## Description

Create clear epic with problem statement, goal, scope, and implementation approach that breaks down PRD requirements into manageable high-level features. This epic enables Story creation and provides a clear feature grouping for development teams.

## Prerequisites

- [ ] **Completed PRD**: PRD exists at `/docs/prd/prd.md` with BR/NFR requirements defined
- [ ] **Epic priority identified**: Clear understanding of which PRD requirements this Epic addresses
- [ ] **User context available**: Target users and use cases from PRD understood
- [ ] **Epic scope defined**: Boundaries of what this Epic includes and excludes

### Reference Assets

Dependencies:

- ./.krci-ai/data/common/sdlc-framework.md
- ./.krci-ai/data/prioritization-frameworks.md
- ./.krci-ai/templates/epic.md

Validation: Verify all dependencies exist at specified paths before proceeding. HALT if any missing.

## Instructions

1. **Follow SDLC workflow**: Reference [sdlc-framework.md](./.krci-ai/data/common/sdlc-framework.md) for Epic dependencies and artifact flow
2. **Apply prioritization**: Use methods from [prioritization-frameworks.md](./.krci-ai/data/prioritization-frameworks.md)
3. **Format output**: Use [epic.md](./.krci-ai/templates/epic.md) template with all variables populated
4. **Ensure PRD traceability**: Reference specific BR/NFR requirements from PRD
5. **Enforce agent-optimization**: Follow enhanced template requirements for consistent agent-parseable structure

## Agent-Optimized Template Enforcement

### Required Format Validation

**CRITICAL**: All epics must follow these agent-optimized patterns:

- **Goal Format**: MUST follow "Enable [specific outcome] for [target %] of [user type] within [timeline]"
- **Dependencies Structure**: MUST group using exact headers "Epic Dependencies:", "System Dependencies:", "External Dependencies:"
- **Acceptance Criteria**: MUST include validation method AND verification command for each criterion
- **User Stories**: MUST use phase-based grouping with "**Phase X: Name**" headers and dependency notation

### Quality Gates

Before epic creation, verify:

1. **Goal Measurability**: Goal contains specific outcome, target percentage, user type, and timeline
2. **Dependencies Grouping**: All dependencies properly categorized with required headers
3. **Acceptance Criteria Commands**: Each criterion includes both validation method and testable command
4. **Agent-Parseable Structure**: Consistent formatting enables automated processing

### Validation Commands

Post-creation verification:

- Goal format: `echo "[goal_text]" | grep -E "Enable .* for [0-9]+% .* within .*"`
- Dependencies structure: `grep -E "^(Epic|System|External) Dependencies:" [epic_file]`
- Acceptance commands: `grep -E "Command: \`.*\`" [epic_file]`

## Output Format

- **Location**: `/docs/epics/{epic_number}-epic-{slug}.md` (EXACT naming pattern)
- **Epic numbering**: Sequential number based on existing epics (check `/docs/epics/` folder)
- **Slug format**: Lowercase, hyphenated description (e.g., "ide-integration", "core-engine")
- **Downstream Enable**: Enables Story creation at `/docs/stories/`

## Success Criteria

- [ ] **File saved** to `/docs/epics/{epic_number}-epic-{slug}.md` with correct naming
- [ ] **PRD traceability** clear connection to specific BR/NFR requirements
- [ ] **Problem clarity** epic solves a specific user problem with defined scope
- [ ] **Goal measurability** epic completion criteria are specific and testable
- [ ] **Story readiness** epic provides enough detail for Story breakdown
- [ ] **Template compliance** all template variables populated correctly
- [ ] **Agent-optimization** epic follows enhanced template requirements for consistent structure
- [ ] **Goal format compliance** goal follows "Enable X for Y% of [users] within [timeline]" pattern
- [ ] **Dependencies structure** all dependencies grouped by Epic/System/External with exact headers
- [ ] **Acceptance criteria commands** each criterion includes validation method and verification command
- [ ] **Quality gates passed** all validation commands execute successfully

## Overview

### Problem Statement

{{problem_statement}}

<!-- Clear, specific user or business problem this Epic solves from PRD analysis -->
<!-- Must trace back to PRD business requirements and user pain points -->

<!-- Template Guidance:
Problem Statement Example:
"Users struggle to activate and use agents consistently across supported IDEs, causing rework and reduced productivity. Inconsistent activation flows generate support tickets and block onboarding."

Format Structure:
- Start with specific user pain point from PRD
- Include quantifiable impact or evidence (if already available)
- Connect to PRD BR/NFR requirements
- Avoid solution-oriented language

DO:
- Tie the problem to concrete PRD BR/NFR references
- Use user-centric language and observable effects
- Include evidence or impact where available

DON'T:
- Prescribe solutions or technical designs here
- Use vague terms without context (e.g., "better", "faster")
- Omit explicit traceability to PRD
-->

### Goal

{{goal}}

<!-- Capability delivered statement that defines Epic completion -->
<!-- Be outcome-focused and verifiable immediately after implementation in a controlled environment -->
<!-- Optional: add success indicators ONLY if they can be verified post-implementation without third-party analytics or unavailable data -->

<!-- Template Guidance:
Goal Examples (choose one style appropriate for your context):
- "Deliver a consistent agent activation capability across target IDEs with a single, predictable user flow."
- "Provide single sign-on capability across portal and tools using an internal IDP/test stub for validation."

Notes:
- You may optionally link to OKRs if they are already active and verifiable during/after the release.
- Avoid speculative future metrics and long-horizon targets that cannot be checked immediately after delivery.

DO:
- State the capability in plain language (outcome, not implementation)
- Include near-term indicators only if verifiable post-implementation
- Align with the Problem Statement and PRD scope

DON'T:
- Force %/timeline when measurement isnâ€™t feasible yet
- Embed tool-specific testing details
- Drift into story-level scope
-->

### Target Users

{{target_users}}

<!-- Specific user personas from PRD who benefit from this Epic -->
<!-- Must align with PRD user segments and enable Story "As a user" scenarios -->

<!-- Template Guidance:
Target Users Example:
"Primary: Software Engineers and Architects â€“ installing and activating agents in supported IDEs
Secondary: QA Engineers â€“ validating agent behavior across environments
Tertiary: Product Managers â€“ tracking readiness for release"

Format Structure:
- List primary, secondary, tertiary users and their context
- Connect to PRD user segments and persona definitions

DO:
- Use PRD-defined personas and segments
- Provide enough context for story persona scenarios
- Keep the list focused on actual beneficiaries

DON'T:
- Invent new roles not present in PRD
- Use generic labels like "users" or "developers" without context
- Omit the user context and responsibilities
-->

## Scope

### What's Included

{{in_scope}}

<!-- Specific features and functionality this Epic delivers -->
<!-- Must map to PRD requirements and enable Story breakdown -->

<!-- Template Guidance:
What's Included Example:
"1. Unified activation flow across Cursor, VS Code, and JetBrains IDEs (BR2, BR3)
2. Session continuity within a workday across integrated tools (BR5)
3. Basic error handling and user messaging for failed activations (NFR-UX1)
4. Local test IDP/stubs or mocks where external dependencies would otherwise be required (NFR-TEST1)"

Format Structure:
- Number items for clear tracking
- Reference specific PRD requirements in parentheses
- Focus on user-facing functionality and immediately testable outcomes

DO:
- Keep items independently verifiable after implementation
- Reference BR/NFR for each included capability
- Prefer outcomes over implementation detail

DON'T:
- Include low-level design or non-essential technical tasks
- Add third-party dependencies that block local validation
- Blur boundaries with "Whatâ€™s Not Included"
-->

### What's Not Included

{{out_of_scope}}

<!-- Clear boundaries of what this Epic excludes to prevent scope creep -->

<!-- Template Guidance:
What's Not Included Example:
"1. Production analytics dashboards for adoption metrics (handled in separate analytics Epic)
2. Advanced SSO federation across multiple enterprise providers (future roadmap)
3. Legacy IDE support beyond current LTS versions (deferred)"

DO:
- Explain rationale (deferred, out of scope, future epic)
- Point to related epics when applicable
- Protect the MVP boundary

DON'T:
- List ambiguous exclusions without justification
- Duplicate items that already appear in scope
- Use exclusions to mask undecided scope
-->

### Dependencies

{{dependencies}}

<!-- Other Epics, systems, or external requirements this Epic needs -->
<!-- Design acceptance criteria so they can be verified without reliance on third-party services; if unavoidable, specify stubs/mocks -->

<!-- Template Guidance:
Dependencies Example (grouping encouraged but not mandated):
"Epic Dependencies:
- Epic 1: Baseline infrastructure
- Epic 2: Core engine enhancements

System/Test Dependencies:
- Local IDP stub for SSO validation
- Supported IDE versions (latest stable) available in CI/staging

External Dependencies (if any):
- Security review sign-off (if policy requires before release)"

DO:
- Call out stubs/mocks to avoid third-party blockers
- Specify versions/constraints that affect validation
- Separate epic/system/external dependencies for clarity

DON'T:
- Depend on production-only services for acceptance
- Leave approvals/integration needs implicit
- Use vague placeholders (e.g., "some SSO")
-->

## Solution Approach

{{solution_approach}}

<!-- High-level implementation strategy and architectural direction -->
<!-- Guides Story creation without prescribing detailed implementation -->

<!-- Template Guidance:
Keep this section at architectural and capability level:
- Key integration points and boundaries
- Feature flags/toggles for safe rollout
- Use of stubs or test doubles to decouple from third-party services during validation

DO:
- Describe integration boundaries and toggles for safe rollout
- Prefer approaches enabling immediate post-implementation verification
- Note key risks and how validation addresses them

DON'T:
- Specify tool commands or low-level implementation detail
- Overconstrain design choices prematurely
- Ignore rollout/operational considerations
-->

## Risks & Assumptions

{{risks_and_assumptions}}

<!-- Key uncertainties that may impact delivery or validation; distinct from Solution Approach -->
<!-- Capture assumptions that, if false, would invalidate scope or acceptance -->

<!-- Template Guidance:
Risks & Assumptions Examples:
- Risk: Supported IDE API changes could break activation flow near release
- Risk: Security approval needed before enabling cross-tool session persistence
- Assumption: Local IDP stub is available for SSO validation
- Assumption: Feature flags can be toggled per environment

DO:
- State risks with potential impact and a mitigation idea
- Make assumptions explicit and testable
- Keep items tied to epic scope and acceptance

DON'T:
- Duplicate dependencies; reference them if needed
- List generic project risks unrelated to acceptance
- Leave critical assumptions implicit
-->

## Acceptance Criteria

{{acceptance_criteria}}

<!-- Epic-level, outcome-focused, and immediately verifiable post-implementation -->
<!-- Do NOT prescribe verification commands or specific tools -->
<!-- Avoid dependence on third-party services; if required, define local stubs/mocks -->

<!-- Required Structure for each criterion:
1. Scenario: Brief user/system flow to validate
2. Expected Behavior: Clear, observable outcome
3. Measurement/Method: How we confirm now (manual steps, UI/API observation, logs), without prescribing tools/commands
4. Preconditions/Assumptions: Feature flags, environment, stubs/mocks, test users
5. Guardrails: Quality constraints (e.g., no P0/P1 defects in core flow; basic performance/security thresholds)
6. Deferred (non-blocking): Optional indicator that cannot be immediately verified (use sparingly)
-->
<!-- Note: "Deferred (non-blocking)" items do not gate epic closure. Track them in analytics/ops epics or release notes. -->

<!-- Template Guidance:
Acceptance Criteria Example (Epic-level, scenario-based, no third-party dependency):
"1. Cross-IDE agent activation consistency
   - Scenario: User activates a selected agent in Cursor, VS Code, and JetBrains using the unified flow
   - Expected Behavior: Activation completes successfully with consistent steps and end state across IDEs
   - Measurement/Method: Perform activation in staging across supported IDEs; verify final activated state and absence of additional prompts
   - Preconditions/Assumptions: Supported IDE versions installed; feature flag 'unifiedActivation' enabled
   - Guardrails: No P0/P1 defects in activation core path; added startup latency <= 200ms
   - Traceability: BR2, BR3

2. Session continuity within a workday
   - Scenario: User logs in using SSO, switches between tools during the day without re-authentication
   - Expected Behavior: Session persists across tools; no additional credential prompts within policy window
   - Measurement/Method: Repeat access across tools within configured TTL; observe uninterrupted access and valid session tokens
   - Preconditions/Assumptions: Local session store enabled; policy TTL configured for staging
   - Guardrails: Logout invalidates access across tools within 60 seconds; no partial-auth states
   - Deferred (non-blocking): Track adoption rate post-release (handled by analytics Epic)
   - Traceability: BR5, NFR-SEC

3. Error handling and recovery
   - Scenario: Activation fails due to a simulated dependency outage (via stub/mocking)
   - Expected Behavior: User sees a clear, actionable message; retry succeeds once dependency is restored
   - Measurement/Method: Toggle failure in stub; verify UX message, no corrupted state, successful retry
   - Preconditions/Assumptions: Failure modes controllable via test stub; feature flag 'activationRetry' enabled
   - Guardrails: No data loss; no unhandled exceptions in logs
   - Traceability: NFR-UX1, NFR-REL"

DO:
- Number criteria for tracking and story mapping
- Keep outcomes measurable/observable now, without requiring external analytics
- Use stubs/mocks to validate flows when real third-party services are unavailable

DON'T:
- Include command-level verification (e.g., CLI, pytest, npm commands)
- Rely on long-horizon metrics or OKRs that cannot be verified immediately after delivery
- Use subjective language like "works well" or "user-friendly" without observable outcomes
-->

## User Stories

{{planned_stories}}

<!-- Planned Stories that implement this Epic with clear breakdown and traceability -->

<!-- Template Guidance:
Recommended Structure:
- Group stories by phases or slices that deliver incremental user value
- Use consistent numbering within the Epic (e.g., {{epic_number}}.01, {{epic_number}}.02, ...)
- Each story should include persona, goal, and minimal acceptance criteria

DO:
- Keep stories INVEST and traceable to epic criteria
- Include dependencies only when necessary and explicit
- Ensure each story yields observable value

DON'T:
- Mix multiple personas/goals in one story
- Leave stories without acceptance criteria
- Skip numbering or phase grouping without reason

Example:
"Phase 1: Foundation
- Story {{epic_number}}.01: Unified activation flow â€“ Cursor
  - As a Software Engineer, I want to activate an agent in Cursor, so that I can use it without extra setup
- Story {{epic_number}}.02: Unified activation flow â€“ VS Code

Phase 2: Parity
- Story {{epic_number}}.03: Unified activation flow â€“ JetBrains
- Story {{epic_number}}.04: Session continuity (intra-day)"

# Product Prioritization Frameworks

## Primary Prioritization Methods

### 1. RICE Framework

Reach, Impact, Confidence, Effort prioritization method.

- **Reach**: How many users will be affected in a given period?
- **Impact**: How much will this increase the key metric per user?
- **Confidence**: How confident are you in your estimates?
- **Effort**: How much time and resources will this require?
- **Score**: (Reach Ã— Impact Ã— Confidence) / Effort

### 2. MoSCoW Method

Must have, Should have, Could have, Won't have prioritization.

- **Must Have**: Critical requirements that must be implemented
- **Should Have**: Important features that add significant value
- **Could Have**: Nice-to-have features that enhance the product
- **Won't Have**: Features that are out of scope for this release

### 3. Value vs Effort Matrix

Two-dimensional prioritization based on value and implementation effort.

- **Quick Wins**: High value, low effort (prioritize first)
- **Big Bets**: High value, high effort (strategic investments)
- **Fill-ins**: Low value, low effort (when capacity allows)
- **Time Wasters**: Low value, high effort (avoid or deprioritize)

### 4. Kano Model

User satisfaction vs feature implementation prioritization.

- **Must-be Features**: Basic expectations that cause dissatisfaction if missing
- **Performance Features**: Features that increase satisfaction linearly
- **Attractive Features**: Delighters that provide competitive advantage
- **Indifferent Features**: Features that don't significantly impact satisfaction

## Advanced Prioritization Techniques

### 5. Weighted Scoring Model

Multi-criteria decision analysis with weighted factors.

- Define evaluation criteria (user impact, business value, technical feasibility)
- Assign weights to each criterion based on importance
- Score each feature against criteria
- Calculate weighted scores for prioritization

### 6. Opportunity Scoring

Prioritization based on importance and satisfaction gaps.

- Survey users on feature importance and current satisfaction
- Calculate opportunity score: Importance + (Importance - Satisfaction)
- Prioritize features with highest opportunity scores
- Focus on important features with low satisfaction

### 7. Story Mapping

User journey-based prioritization for holistic product planning.

- Map user activities and tasks in chronological order
- Identify minimum viable journey for first release
- Prioritize features that support critical user workflows
- Plan subsequent releases to enhance user experience

### 8. Theme-Based Prioritization

Strategic alignment through thematic grouping.

- Group features into strategic themes or outcomes
- Allocate resources across themes based on strategic importance
- Prioritize features within each theme
- Balance portfolio across different strategic areas

## Prioritization Criteria

### Business Value Factors

Criteria for evaluating business impact.

- Revenue impact (direct and indirect)
- Cost savings and efficiency gains
- Market differentiation and competitive advantage
- Strategic alignment with business objectives

### User Value Factors

Criteria for evaluating user impact.

- User satisfaction and experience improvement
- Problem solving and pain point resolution
- Usage frequency and engagement potential

- Market trends and industry direction
- Regulatory and compliance requirements

## Prioritization Process

### 1. Preparation Phase

Setting up for effective prioritization.

- Define prioritization criteria and weights
- Gather stakeholder input and requirements
- Collect relevant data and metrics
- Establish scoring methodology

### 2. Evaluation Phase

Assessing features against criteria.

- Score features using chosen framework

- Document assumptions and rationale
- Identify dependencies and constraints

### 3. Decision Phase

Making prioritization decisions.

- Rank features based on scores
- Consider resource constraints and capacity
- Balance portfolio across strategic themes
- Make final prioritization decisions

### 4. Communication Phase

Sharing prioritization outcomes.

- Document prioritization rationale
- Communicate decisions to stakeholders
- Update roadmaps and planning documents
- Establish review and update processes

## Common Pitfalls and Best Practices

### Pitfalls to Avoid

- Over-reliance on single prioritization method
- Ignoring technical constraints and dependencies
- Lack of stakeholder alignment and buy-in
- Insufficient data for informed decision making

### Best Practices

- Use multiple prioritization methods for validation
