# Design Patterns for Architecture

## Architectural Patterns

### Microservices Pattern

Decompose applications into small, independent services.

- **When to use**: Large, complex applications with multiple teams
- **Benefits**: Independent deployment, technology diversity, fault isolation
- **Considerations**: Network latency, data consistency, operational complexity

### Event-Driven Architecture

Use events to trigger and communicate between decoupled services.

- **When to use**: Real-time processing, loose coupling requirements
- **Benefits**: Scalability, flexibility, real-time responsiveness
- **Considerations**: Event ordering, eventual consistency

### API Gateway Pattern

Centralize cross-cutting concerns for microservices.

- **When to use**: Multiple client types, microservices architecture
- **Benefits**: Unified entry point, security, rate limiting
- **Considerations**: Single point of failure, performance bottleneck

### CQRS (Command Query Responsibility Segregation)

Separate read and write operations for better performance.

- **When to use**: High-read vs high-write workloads
- **Benefits**: Optimized read/write models, scalability
- **Considerations**: Complexity, eventual consistency

## Integration Patterns

### Circuit Breaker

Prevent cascading failures in distributed systems.

- **Implementation**: Monitor failure rates, open circuit on threshold
- **Benefits**: System stability, graceful degradation
- **Tools**: Hystrix, Resilience4j

### Bulkhead

Isolate resources to prevent total system failure.

- **Implementation**: Separate thread pools, connection pools
- **Benefits**: Fault isolation, resource protection

### Retry with Exponential Backoff

Handle transient failures gracefully.

- **Implementation**: Exponential delays between retries
- **Benefits**: Improved reliability, reduced system load

## Data Patterns

### Database per Service

Each microservice owns its data exclusively.

- **Benefits**: Service independence, technology flexibility
- **Considerations**: Data consistency, query complexity

### Saga Pattern

Manage distributed transactions across services.

- **Types**: Choreography-based, Orchestration-based
- **Benefits**: Data consistency without distributed transactions

### Event Sourcing

Store events instead of current state.

- **Benefits**: Complete audit trail, temporal queries
- **Considerations**: Storage overhead, complexity

## Security Patterns

### Zero Trust Architecture

Never trust, always verify approach to security.

- **Principles**: Verify identity, least privilege, assume breach
- **Implementation**: Multi-factor authentication, micro-segmentation

### OAuth 2.0 / OpenID Connect

Standard patterns for authentication and authorization.

- **Use cases**: API access, single sign-on, third-party integration

## Performance Patterns

### Caching Strategies

- **Cache-Aside**: Application manages cache
- **Write-Through**: Write to cache and database simultaneously
- **Write-Behind**: Write to cache first, database later

### Load Balancing

- **Round Robin**: Distribute requests evenly
- **Least Connections**: Route to server with fewest active connections
- **Weighted**: Route based on server capacity
