# Architecture Design Principles

## Core Principles

### 1. Scalability First

Design systems for growth from day one. Consider horizontal and vertical scaling strategies.

- Plan for 10x current load
- Design stateless services where possible
- Use load balancing and auto-scaling

### 2. Security by Design

Implement security at every layer, not as an afterthought.

- Apply defense in depth
- Use principle of least privilege
- Implement secure defaults
- Regular security assessments

### 3. Fault Tolerance

Plan for component failures and graceful degradation.

- Design for failure scenarios
- Implement circuit breakers
- Use redundancy and failover mechanisms
- Plan disaster recovery

### 4. Separation of Concerns

Organize code and components by responsibility.

- Single responsibility principle
- Clear component boundaries
- Minimal coupling between components
- High cohesion within components

### 5. Observability

Build monitoring, logging, and tracing into the system.

- Comprehensive logging strategy
- Real-time monitoring and alerting
- Distributed tracing for complex flows
- Performance metrics and analytics

### 6. Maintainability

Prioritize code and architecture that can be easily understood and modified.

- Clear documentation
- Consistent coding standards
- Automated testing
- Simple deployment processes

### 7. Performance Optimization

Balance performance with maintainability and cost.

- Profile before optimizing
- Focus on bottlenecks
- Consider caching strategies
- Optimize data access patterns

### 8. Evolutionary Architecture

Design for change and adaptation over time.

- Loosely coupled architecture
- API versioning strategy
- Incremental migration paths
- Technology stack flexibility
