# SDLC Framework Quick Reference

Purpose: AI agents collaborate through structured, filesystem-based artifacts. Agents use this document to understand role, dependencies, and locate templates/standards.

## Framework Principles

- Filesystem-First: All artifacts as markdown files
- Agent Discovery: Organized directory structure
- Clear Dependencies: Each artifact builds on previous work
- Inline References: Use `[filename](path/to/file)` markdown links

<roles>
| Role | ID | Outputs | Dependencies | Key Actions |
|------|----|---------|--------------|-----------|
| Product Manager | `pm-v1` | Project Brief, PRD, Roadmap | None (root artifacts) | Market research, strategic vision, requirements validation |
| Project Manager | `prm-v1` | Project Charter, SOW, Project Plan, Risk Register | Project Brief, PRD | Project planning, execution oversight, risk management, stakeholder alignment |
| Business Analyst | `ba-v1` | Refined PRD, Workflows, Business Rules | PRD, Stakeholder inputs | Requirements gathering, workflow design, acceptance criteria, process mapping |
| Product Owner | `po-v1` | Epics, Stories | PRD | Backlog prioritization, sprint planning, story refinement |
| Architect | `architect-v1` | Architecture Documents | PRD, Epics | System design, technical feasibility, architecture patterns |
| Developer | `dev-v1` | Code, Implementation | Stories, Architecture | Feature implementation, code reviews, deployment configs |
| Go Developer | `go-dev-v1` | Go Code, Implementation | Stories, Architecture | Go-specific implementation, testing, performance optimization |
| QA Engineer | `qa-v1` | Test Results, Quality Reports | Stories, Code | Quality validation, test execution, bug reporting |
| Technical Writer | `tw-v1` | Documentation, Media Artifacts | All artifacts | Documentation review, content improvement, presentation enhancement |
| Product Marketing Manager | `pmm-v1` | Marketing Materials, GTM Strategy | PRD, MVP | Go-to-market strategy, sales enablement, launch campaigns |
| Framework Advisor | `advisor-v1` | Framework Components, Validation Reports | None (meta-framework support) | Framework component creation, validation, maintenance guidance |
</roles>

## Artifact Flow

```text
Project Brief → PRD → Epics → Stories → Code → Tests → MVP → Marketing
                  ↓             ↓
              Architecture ← → Code
```

**Flow**: PM(Brief+PRD) → BA(refine) → PO(Epics+Stories) → Arch(design) → Dev(code) → QA(test) → PMM(marketing)

**Dependencies**:

- Project Brief: No dependencies (root)
- PRD: Requires Project Brief
- Epic: Requires PRD completion
- Story: Requires Epic + Architecture
- Code: Requires Stories + Architecture
- Tests: Requires Stories + Code
- Marketing: Requires PRD + MVP

## Artifact Definitions

| Artifact | Creator | Purpose | Contains | File Location |
|----------|---------|---------|----------|---------------|
| **Project Brief** | PM | Project vision & strategy | Problem statement, success metrics, constraints | `/docs/prd/project-brief.md` |
| **PRD** | PM | Product requirements | Business requirements (BR1, BR2...), system requirements (NFR1, NFR2...) | `/docs/prd/prd.md` |
| **Project Charter** | PRM | Project scope & authorization | Objectives, scope, stakeholders, success criteria | `/docs/prd/project-charter.md` |
| **Epic** | PO | High-level feature definition | Feature description, acceptance criteria, story breakdown | `/docs/epics/epic-{number}-{slug}.md` |
| **Story** | PO | User requirement with implementation | User story, acceptance criteria, tasks, deployment info | `/docs/stories/{epic_number}.{story_number}.story.md` |
| **Architecture** | Arch | System design | Technical specifications, patterns, decisions | `/docs/architecture/*.md` |
| **Code** | Dev/Go-Dev | Implementation | Source code, configs, deployment manifests | Repository root & subdirs |
| **Test Results** | QA | Quality validation | Test execution results, defect reports, metrics | `/docs/tests/test-results-*.md` |
| **Marketing Materials** | PMM | Go-to-market strategy | Pitch decks, sales enablement, campaigns | `/docs/marketing/*.md` |
| **Framework Components** | Advisor | Framework maintenance | Agents, tasks, templates, validation reports | `/.krci-ai/{agents,tasks,templates}/*.md` |

2. PRD Approval → Enables Epic/Architecture creation
3. Architecture Review → Enables implementation
4. Code Review → Enables testing
5. Test Validation → Enables MVP delivery

Enforcement: All `{{variables}}` filled, dependencies satisfied, template format followed.
</quality_gates>

<handoff_points>

1. Idea → PM: Market research
2. PM → BA: PRD refinement
3. BA → PO: Requirements to backlog

5. Arch → Dev: Implementation guidance
6. Dev → QA: Quality validation
7. QA → MVP: Deployment readiness
8. PM → PMM: Go-to-market strategy
9. MVP → PMM: Marketing materials

Validation: Upstream artifacts complete, quality gates passed.
</handoff_points>

<common_issues>

| Issue | Resolution | Agent Action |
|-------|------------|--------------|
| Epic creation blocked | PRD incomplete | Return to Product Manager for PRD completion |
| Story blocked by Architecture | Architecture not defined | Complete Architecture Document before Story creation |
| Implementation blocked | Story criteria unclear | Return to Product Owner for Story refinement |
| Testing blocked | Code incomplete | Ensure Developer completes all Story requirements |
| Template variables unfilled | Validation failed | Complete all `{{variables}}` using referenced templates |
| Framework component errors | Validation failed | Consult Framework Advisor for component creation/fixes |

</common_issues>

<agent_workflow>

1. Find role in `<roles>` table (ID, outputs, dependencies)
2. Check dependencies exist and approved
3. Load templates: `.krci-ai/templates/{artifact-template}.md`
4. Execute task: `.krci-ai/tasks/{task-name}.md`
5. Validate: No `{{variables}}` unfilled, dependencies referenced
6. Quality gate: Standards met before handoff

Path examples: `.krci-ai/templates/story.md`
</agent_workflow>

## Template Variables

Templates use `{{variable_name}}` format. Required fields must be populated.
Example: `{{epic_title}}` → "User Authentication System"

### Template Conventions

CRITICAL: XML tags in templates are agent guidance only - exclude from final output.

<success_flow>
Idea → PM (Brief+PRD) → BA (Analysis) → PO (Epics+Stories) → Architect (Design) → Developer/Go Developer (Code) → QA (Tests) → MVP → PMM (Marketing)
</success_flow>

<implementation>
Agent: YAML (identity, commands, tasks)
Task: Markdown workflows with templates/data references
Template: Markdown with `{{variables}}`
Data: Standards and specifications

```yaml
agent:
  identity:
    name: "Role Name"
    id: "role-id-v1"
  commands:
    help: "Show commands"
    chat: "Role consultation"
    exit: "Exit persona"
  tasks:
    - "./.krci-ai/tasks/{task-name}.md"
```

</implementation>
