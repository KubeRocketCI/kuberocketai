- **Process**: Activities that transform inputs into outputs
- **Outputs**: Products, services, or information produced by the process
- **Customers**: Recipients or users of the process outputs

### Value Stream Mapping

Visual tool for analyzing and improving process flow.

- **Implementation Plan**: Roadmap for transitioning to future state
- **Continuous Improvement**: Regular review and optimization cycles

## Stakeholder Analysis Frameworks

### RACI Matrix

Framework for defining roles and responsibilities in processes and projects.

- **Responsible**: Person who performs the activity or task
- **Accountable**: Person who is ultimately answerable for the activity
- **Consulted**: People who provide input and expertise
- **Informed**: People who need to be kept informed of progress

### Power-Interest Grid

Framework for stakeholder analysis and engagement strategy.

- **High Power, High Interest**: Key stakeholders requiring active management
- **High Power, Low Interest**: Stakeholders to keep satisfied
- **Low Power, High Interest**: Stakeholders to keep informed
- **Low Power, Low Interest**: Stakeholders requiring minimal effort

### Stakeholder Onion Diagram

Visual framework for mapping stakeholder relationships and influence.

- **Core**: Direct users and beneficiaries of the solution
- **Direct**: Stakeholders directly impacted by the solution
- **Indirect**: Stakeholders indirectly affected by the solution
- **External**: External stakeholders with potential influence

## Problem Analysis Frameworks

### Root Cause Analysis (5 Whys)

Systematic approach to identifying underlying causes of problems.

- **Problem Statement**: Clear definition of the observed problem
- **Why Analysis**: Repeatedly ask "why" to drill down to root causes
- **Cause Verification**: Validate identified causes with evidence
- **Solution Development**: Address root causes rather than symptoms

### Fishbone Diagram (Ishikawa)

Visual tool for systematic problem analysis and cause identification.

- **Problem Definition**: Clear statement of the effect or problem
- **Cause Categories**: People, Process, Technology, Environment, Materials
- **Brainstorming**: Generate potential causes within each category
- **Analysis**: Investigate and validate the most likely causes

### Force Field Analysis

Framework for analyzing forces supporting and opposing change.

- **Driving Forces**: Factors that support the desired change
- **Restraining Forces**: Factors that resist or oppose the change
- **Force Assessment**: Evaluate strength and impact of each force
- **Strategy Development**: Strengthen driving forces and mitigate restraining forces

## Solution Design Frameworks

### Design Thinking

Human-centered approach to innovation and solution development.

- **Empathize**: Understand user needs and perspectives
- **Define**: Synthesize observations into problem statements
- **Ideate**: Generate creative solution alternatives
- **Prototype**: Build testable representations of solutions
- **Test**: Validate solutions with users and stakeholders

### Jobs-to-be-Done Framework

Framework for understanding customer motivation and solution design.

- **Job Definition**: Identify the fundamental job customers are trying to accomplish
- **Job Mapping**: Break down the job into sequential steps
- **Outcome Identification**: Define desired outcomes for each job step
- **Solution Design**: Create solutions that help customers complete jobs better
