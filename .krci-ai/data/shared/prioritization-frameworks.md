# Product Prioritization Frameworks

## Primary Prioritization Methods

<primary_methods>

### RICE Framework

Reach, Impact, Confidence, Effort prioritization method.

- Reach: How many users will be affected in a given period?
- Impact: How much will this increase the key metric per user?
- Confidence: How confident are you in your estimates?
- Effort: How much time and resources will this require?
- Score: (Reach × Impact × Confidence) / Effort

### MoSCoW Method

Must have, Should have, Could have, Won't have prioritization.

- Must Have: Critical requirements that must be implemented
- Should Have: Important features that add significant value
- Could Have: Nice-to-have features that enhance the product
- Won't Have: Features that are out of scope for this release

### Value vs Effort Matrix

Two-dimensional prioritization based on value and implementation effort.

- Quick Wins: High value, low effort (prioritize first)
- Big Bets: High value, high effort (strategic investments)
- Fill-ins: Low value, low effort (when capacity allows)
- Time Wasters: Low value, high effort (avoid or deprioritize)

### Kano Model

User satisfaction vs feature implementation prioritization.

- Must-be Features: Basic expectations that cause dissatisfaction if missing
- Performance Features: Features that increase satisfaction linearly
- Attractive Features: Delighters that provide competitive advantage
- Indifferent Features: Features that don't significantly impact satisfaction

## Advanced Prioritization Techniques

<advanced_techniques>

### Weighted Scoring Model

Multi-criteria decision analysis with weighted factors.

- Define evaluation criteria (user impact, business value, technical feasibility)
- Assign weights to each criterion based on importance
- Score each feature against criteria
- Calculate weighted scores for prioritization

### Opportunity Scoring

Prioritization based on importance and satisfaction gaps.

- Survey users on feature importance and current satisfaction
- Calculate opportunity score: Importance + (Importance - Satisfaction)
- Prioritize features with highest opportunity scores
- Focus on important features with low satisfaction

### Story Mapping

User journey-based prioritization for holistic product planning.

- Map user activities and tasks in chronological order
- Identify minimum viable journey for first release
- Prioritize features that support critical user workflows
- Plan subsequent releases to enhance user experience

### Theme-Based Prioritization

Strategic alignment through thematic grouping.

- Group features into strategic themes or outcomes
- Allocate resources across themes based on strategic importance
- Prioritize features within each theme
- Balance portfolio across different strategic areas

## Prioritization Criteria

<prioritization_criteria>

### Business Value Factors

Criteria for evaluating business impact.

- Revenue impact (direct and indirect)
- Cost savings and efficiency gains
- Market differentiation and competitive advantage
- Strategic alignment with business objectives

### User Value Factors

Criteria for evaluating user impact.

- User satisfaction and experience improvement
- Problem solving and pain point resolution
- Usage frequency and engagement potential
- User segment size and importance

### Technical Factors

Criteria for evaluating implementation considerations.

- Development complexity and effort estimation
- Technical debt and maintenance implications
- Dependencies and prerequisites
- Risk assessment and mitigation strategies

### Market Factors

Criteria for evaluating market considerations.

- Competitive pressure and market timing
- Customer requests and feedback frequency
- Market trends and industry direction
- Regulatory and compliance requirements

## Prioritization Process

<prioritization_process>

### Preparation Phase

Setting up for effective prioritization.

- Define prioritization criteria and weights
- Gather stakeholder input and requirements
- Collect relevant data and metrics
- Establish scoring methodology

### Evaluation Phase

Assessing features against criteria.

- Score features using chosen framework
- Validate scores with stakeholders
- Document assumptions and rationale
- Identify dependencies and constraints

### Decision Phase

Making prioritization decisions.

- Rank features based on scores
- Consider resource constraints and capacity
- Balance portfolio across strategic themes
- Make final prioritization decisions

### Communication Phase

Sharing prioritization outcomes.

- Document prioritization rationale
- Communicate decisions to stakeholders
- Update roadmaps and planning documents
- Establish review and update processes
</prioritization_process>

## Common Pitfalls and Best Practices

<best_practices>

### Pitfalls to Avoid

- Over-reliance on single prioritization method
- Ignoring technical constraints and dependencies
- Lack of stakeholder alignment and buy-in
- Insufficient data for informed decision making

### Best Practices

- Use multiple prioritization methods for validation
- Involve diverse stakeholders in prioritization process
- Regular review and update of priorities
- Clear communication of prioritization criteria and rationale
