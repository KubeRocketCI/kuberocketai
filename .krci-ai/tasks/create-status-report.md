# Task: Create Project Status Report

## Description

Create a comprehensive project status report that provides stakeholders with clear visibility into project progress, performance, risks, and upcoming activities. The status report serves as the primary communication vehicle for project performance information and supports informed decision-making throughout the project lifecycle.

<prerequisites>
- Project plan and baseline established
- Performance measurement systems operational
- Current project data and metrics available
- Stakeholder communication requirements defined
- Reporting templates and standards established
</prerequisites>

## Reference Assets

**Primary Dependencies:**
- Project management methodology: [project-management-methodology.md](./.krci-ai/data/project-management-methodology.md)
- Template: [status-report-template.md](./.krci-ai/templates/status-report-template.md)
- Project plan, schedule, and budget documents
- Risk register and quality metrics

**Optional Supporting Materials:**
- Earned value management data
- Stakeholder communication plan
- Previous status reports for trend analysis

<instructions>
1. Performance Data Collection:
   - Schedule Performance: Collect current schedule status and milestone progress, calculate schedule performance index (SPI) and variance, identify completed, in-progress, and upcoming activities, analyze critical path status and potential delays
   - Cost Performance: Gather current budget status and expenditure data, calculate cost performance index (CPI) and variance, prepare earned value analysis and forecasting, identify cost trends and potential budget impacts
   - Scope Performance: Review deliverable completion status and quality, document scope changes and their impact, assess stakeholder satisfaction with deliverables, identify scope-related issues or concerns

2. Progress Analysis and Reporting:
   - Accomplishments Summary: Document key achievements since last reporting period, highlight completed milestones and deliverables, recognize team accomplishments and successes, present positive project outcomes and value delivered
   - Current Status Assessment: Provide clear picture of current project position, analyze performance against planned baselines, identify areas of strong performance and concern, present objective assessment of project health
   - Variance Analysis: Identify significant variances from planned performance, analyze root causes of schedule or cost deviations, assess impact of variances on project objectives, present corrective actions and recovery plans

3. Risk and Issue Management:
   - Risk Status Update: Review current risk register and priority changes, report on risk response implementation and effectiveness, identify new risks and their potential impact, present risk trend analysis and outlook
   - Issue Resolution: Document current issues and their resolution status, report on issue escalation and decision requirements, identify blocking issues requiring stakeholder intervention, present issue trends and patterns

4. Future Outlook and Planning:
   - Upcoming Activities: Present planned activities for next reporting period, highlight critical milestones and deliverables, identify resource requirements and dependencies, communicate stakeholder involvement needs
   - Forecast and Projections: Provide updated project completion forecasts, present budget and resource requirement projections, analyze potential risks and their impact on forecasts, communicate confidence levels and assumptions
</instructions>

## Output Format

**Primary Deliverable:**
Use template: [status-report-template.md](./.krci-ai/templates/status-report-template.md)

**Document Structure:**
- Executive summary (key highlights and concerns)
- Project overview and current phase status
- Schedule performance and milestone progress
- Budget performance and financial status
- Scope progress and deliverable status
- Quality metrics and stakeholder satisfaction
- Risk and issue status with priority updates
- Team performance and resource utilization
- Upcoming activities and critical decisions
- Forecast and recommendations
- Appendices with detailed data and metrics

<success_criteria>
- Report Completeness: All required performance areas covered thoroughly, current status accurately represented with supporting data, variance analysis provides clear insights and explanations, risk and issue status comprehensively updated, future outlook and forecasts properly supported
- Communication Effectiveness: Executive summary highlights key information clearly, report format appropriate for intended audience, information presented objectively and professionally, action items and decisions clearly identified, stakeholder information needs addressed
- Data Quality: Performance data accurate and current, metrics calculations correct and validated, trend analysis supported by historical data, forecasts based on realistic assumptions, supporting documentation available and referenced
</success_criteria>
