# Task: Create Product Requirements Document (PRD)

## Description

Create a streamlined PRD that drives team alignment on what to build and why, following the proven 6-8 page structure focused on user needs and business value rather than technical specifications. This PRD enables Epic and Story creation while maintaining clear traceability from Project Brief through implementation.

## Prerequisites

- [ ] **Required**: Completed and approved Project Brief at `/docs/prd/project-brief.md`
- [ ] Market research and user insights available
- [ ] Stakeholder requirements gathered and prioritized
- [ ] Technical feasibility assessment completed (if complex features)

## Instructions

1. **Follow SDLC workflow**: Reference [sdlc-framework.md](./.krci-ai/data/common/sdlc-framework.md) for PRD dependencies and quality gates
2. **Use business frameworks**: Apply methodologies from [business-frameworks.md](./.krci-ai/data/business-frameworks.md)
3. **Format output**: Use [prd-template.md](./.krci-ai/templates/prd-template.md) for structure
4. **Ensure traceability**: Link back to Project Brief and enable Epic creation

## Output Format

- **Location**: `/docs/prd/prd.md` (EXACT path and filename)
- **Length**: 6-8 pages maximum for team consumption
- **Requirements Format**: Use BR1, BR2, BR3... for business requirements and NFR1, NFR2, NFR3... for system requirements with P0/P1/P2 priority indicators
- **Downstream Enable**: Enables Epic creation at `/docs/epics/` and Architecture at `/docs/architecture/`

## Success Criteria

- [ ] **File saved** to `/docs/prd/prd.md`
- [ ] **Length** is 6-8 pages maximum
- [ ] **Requirements numbered** (BR1, BR2, NFR1, NFR2) with priority indicators for Epic mapping
- [ ] **Project Brief link** clear connection to problem/opportunity
- [ ] **Epic enablement** requirements structured for breakdown into Epic features
- [ ] **User focus** prioritizes user needs over technical implementation details
- [ ] **Stakeholder alignment** all key requirements captured and validated

## Execution Checklist

### Discovery Phase

- [ ] **Problem analysis**: Extract core problem from Project Brief
- [ ] **User research**: Conduct user interviews and usage analysis
- [ ] **Competitive analysis**: Research existing solutions and gaps
- [ ] **Stakeholder alignment**: Validate requirements with key stakeholders

### Requirements Phase

- [ ] **Business requirements**: Define BR1, BR2, BR3... (what business functionality is needed)
- [ ] **Non-functional requirements**: Define NFR1, NFR2, NFR3... (how system should behave/perform)
- [ ] **Priority assignment**: Add P0/P1/P2 priority indicators to each requirement
- [ ] **Epic groupings**: Structure requirements into logical Epic themes

### Design Phase

- [ ] **Solution approach**: High-level solution direction (not technical details)
- [ ] **MVP scope**: Define minimum viable product features
- [ ] **Out of scope**: Clearly document what's excluded
- [ ] **Dependencies**: Identify external requirements and constraints

### Documentation Phase

- [ ] **PRD creation**: Use [prd-template.md](./.krci-ai/templates/prd-template.md) structure
- [ ] **Content validation**: Ensure all required sections completed
- [ ] **Length verification**: Confirm document is 6-8 pages maximum
- [ ] **File placement**: Save to exact location `/docs/prd/prd.md`

## Content Guidelines

### Quality Principles for LLM Self-Evaluation

- **User-Centered**: Always prioritize user needs over technical implementation details
- **Evidence-Based**: Support all requirements with user research and business data
- **Traceable**: Maintain clear connection from Project Brief → PRD → Epic creation
- **Measurable**: Ensure all success metrics are specific, testable, and time-bound

### LLM Error Prevention Checklist

- **Avoid**: Technical implementation details (save for Architecture documents)
- **Avoid**: Solution-oriented problem statements (focus on user pain points)
- **Avoid**: Vague requirements that cannot map to Epic features
- **Reference**: Use [prd-template.md](./.krci-ai/templates/prd-template.md) for all formatting guidance and examples

### SDLC Integration Context

This PRD enables immediate Epic creation by providing numbered requirements (BR1, BR2, NFR1...) with priorities that Epics can reference, requirement groupings that map to Epic themes, and success metrics that become Epic acceptance criteria.
