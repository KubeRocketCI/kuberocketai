# Task: Create Product Requirements Document (PRD)

## Description

Create a streamlined PRD that drives team alignment on what to build and why, following the proven 6-8 page structure focused on user needs and business value rather than technical specifications. This PRD includes epic-level feature definitions while maintaining clear traceability from Project Brief.

## Prerequisites

- [ ] **Required**: Completed and approved Project Brief at `/docs/prd/project-brief.md`
- [ ] Market research and user insights available
- [ ] Stakeholder requirements gathered and prioritized
- [ ] Technical feasibility assessment completed (if complex features)

### Reference Assets

Dependencies:

- ./.krci-ai/data/common/sdlc-framework.md
- ./.krci-ai/data/business-frameworks.md
- ./.krci-ai/templates/prd-template.md

Validation: Verify all dependencies exist at specified paths before proceeding. HALT if any missing.

## Instructions

1. **Follow SDLC workflow**: Reference [sdlc-framework.md](./.krci-ai/data/common/sdlc-framework.md) for PRD dependencies and quality gates
2. **Use business frameworks**: Apply methodologies from [business-frameworks.md](./.krci-ai/data/business-frameworks.md)
3. **Format output**: Use [prd-template.md](./.krci-ai/templates/prd-template.md) for structure
4. **Ensure traceability**: Link back to Project Brief and include epic-level feature definitions

## Output Format

- **Location**: `/docs/prd/prd.md` (EXACT path and filename)
- **Length**: 6-8 pages maximum for team consumption
- **Requirements Format**: Use BR1, BR2, BR3... for business requirements and NFR1, NFR2, NFR3... for system requirements with P0/P1/P2 priority indicators and epic-level feature definitions
- **Downstream Enable**: Provides clear requirements structure for development teams

## Success Criteria

- [ ] **File saved** to `/docs/prd/prd.md`
- [ ] **Length** is 6-8 pages maximum
- [ ] **Requirements numbered** (BR1, BR2, NFR1, NFR2) with priority indicators and epic-level features
- [ ] **Project Brief link** clear connection to problem/opportunity
- [ ] **Feature structure** requirements organized into logical epic-level themes
- [ ] **User focus** prioritizes user needs over technical implementation details
- [ ] **Stakeholder alignment** all key requirements captured and validated

## Execution Checklist

### Discovery Phase

- [ ] **Problem analysis**: Extract core problem from Project Brief
- [ ] **User research**: Conduct user interviews and usage analysis
- [ ] **Competitive analysis**: Research existing solutions and gaps
- [ ] **Stakeholder alignment**: Validate requirements with key stakeholders

### Requirements Phase

- [ ] **Business requirements**: Define BR1, BR2, BR3... (what business functionality is needed)
- [ ] **Non-functional requirements**: Define NFR1, NFR2, NFR3... (how system should behave/perform)
- [ ] **Priority assignment**: Add P0/P1/P2 priority indicators to each requirement
- [ ] **Epic groupings**: Structure requirements into logical epic-level feature themes within the PRD

### Design Phase

- [ ] **Solution approach**: High-level solution direction (not technical details)
- [ ] **MVP scope**: Define minimum viable product features
- [ ] **Out of scope**: Clearly document what's excluded
- [ ] **Dependencies**: Identify external requirements and constraints

### Documentation Phase

- [ ] **PRD creation**: Use [prd-template.md](./.krci-ai/templates/prd-template.md) structure
- [ ] **Content validation**: Ensure all required sections completed
- [ ] **Length verification**: Confirm document is 6-8 pages maximum
- [ ] **File placement**: Save to exact location `/docs/prd/prd.md`

## Content Guidelines

### Quality Principles for LLM Self-Evaluation

- **User-Centered**: Always prioritize user needs over technical implementation details
- **Evidence-Based**: Support all requirements with user research and business data
- **Traceable**: Maintain clear connection from Project Brief â†’ PRD with epic-level features
- **Measurable**: Ensure all success metrics are specific, testable, and time-bound

### LLM Error Prevention Checklist

- **Avoid**: Technical implementation details (save for Architecture documents)
- **Avoid**: Solution-oriented problem statements (focus on user pain points)
- **Avoid**: Vague requirements that cannot be grouped into epic-level features
- **Reference**: Use [prd-template.md](./.krci-ai/templates/prd-template.md) for all formatting guidance and examples

### SDLC Integration Context

This PRD provides numbered requirements (BR1, BR2, NFR1...) with priorities organized into epic-level feature themes, requirement groupings that structure development work, and success metrics that guide implementation decisions.
