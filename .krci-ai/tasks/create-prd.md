# Task: Create Product Requirements Document (PRD)

## Description

Create a streamlined PRD that drives team alignment on what to build and why, following the proven 6-8 page structure focused on user needs and business value rather than technical specifications. This PRD enables Epic and Story creation while maintaining clear traceability from Project Brief through implementation.

## Framework Context

**Reference**: [sdlc-framework.md](./.krci-ai/data/common/sdlc-framework.md) - See role responsibilities and artifact flow

## Prerequisites

- [ ] **Required**: Completed and approved Project Brief at `/docs/prd/project-brief.md`
- [ ] Market research and user insights available
- [ ] Stakeholder requirements gathered and prioritized
- [ ] Technical feasibility assessment completed (if complex features)

## Instructions

1. **Follow SDLC workflow**: Reference [sdlc-framework.md](./.krci-ai/data/common/sdlc-framework.md) for PRD dependencies and quality gates
2. **Use business frameworks**: Apply methodologies from [business-frameworks.md](./.krci-ai/data/business-frameworks.md)
3. **Format output**: Use [prd-template.md](./.krci-ai/templates/prd-template.md) for structure
4. **Ensure traceability**: Link back to Project Brief and enable Epic creation

## Output Format

- **Location**: `/docs/prd/prd.md` (EXACT path and filename)
- **Length**: 6-8 pages maximum for team consumption
- **Requirements Format**: Use BR1, BR2, BR3... for business requirements and NFR1, NFR2, NFR3... for system requirements with P0/P1/P2 priority indicators
- **Downstream Enable**: Enables Epic creation at `/docs/epics/` and Architecture at `/docs/architecture/`

## Success Criteria

- [ ] **File saved** to `/docs/prd/prd.md`
- [ ] **Length** is 6-8 pages maximum
- [ ] **Requirements numbered** (BR1, BR2, NFR1, NFR2) with priority indicators for Epic mapping
- [ ] **Project Brief link** clear connection to problem/opportunity
- [ ] **Epic enablement** requirements structured for breakdown into Epic features
- [ ] **User focus** prioritizes user needs over technical implementation details
- [ ] **Stakeholder alignment** all key requirements captured and validated

## Execution Checklist

### Discovery Phase

- [ ] **Problem analysis**: Extract core problem from Project Brief
- [ ] **User research**: Conduct user interviews and usage analysis
- [ ] **Competitive analysis**: Research existing solutions and gaps
- [ ] **Stakeholder alignment**: Validate requirements with key stakeholders

### Requirements Phase

- [ ] **Business requirements**: Define BR1, BR2, BR3... (what business functionality is needed)
- [ ] **Non-functional requirements**: Define NFR1, NFR2, NFR3... (how system should behave/perform)
- [ ] **Priority assignment**: Add P0/P1/P2 priority indicators to each requirement
- [ ] **Epic groupings**: Structure requirements into logical Epic themes

### Design Phase

- [ ] **Solution approach**: High-level solution direction (not technical details)
- [ ] **MVP scope**: Define minimum viable product features
- [ ] **Out of scope**: Clearly document what's excluded
- [ ] **Dependencies**: Identify external requirements and constraints

### Documentation Phase

- [ ] **PRD creation**: Use [prd-template.md](./.krci-ai/templates/prd-template.md) structure
- [ ] **Content validation**: Ensure all required sections completed
- [ ] **Length verification**: Confirm document is 6-8 pages maximum
- [ ] **File placement**: Save to exact location `/docs/prd/prd.md`

## Content Guidelines

### üìã **6 Required Sections:**

1. **Problem/Opportunity**: Crisp definition of user/business problem being solved (from Project Brief)
2. **Target Users & Use Cases**: Specific user segments with demographics and key usage scenarios
3. **Current Journeys/Landscape** *(Optional)*: Context on current user workflows or competitive solutions
4. **Proposed Solution/Elevator Pitch**: High-level solution approach and top 3 MVP value propositions
5. **Goals/Measurable Outcomes**: Specific, measurable success criteria (from Project Brief)
6. **MVP/Functional Requirements**: BR1, BR2, BR3... (business) and NFR1, NFR2, NFR3... (system) with P0/P1/P2 priorities

### ‚úÖ **Quality Standards:**

- **User-Centered**: Always prioritize user needs over technical implementation
- **Evidence-Based**: Support requirements with user research and business data
- **Traceable**: Clear connection from Project Brief problem to Epic-ready requirements
- **Measurable**: All success metrics are specific and testable
- **Actionable**: Requirements clear enough to enable Epic creation

### ‚ùå **Common Pitfalls to Avoid:**

- Technical implementation details (leave for Architecture documents)
- Solution-oriented problem statements (focus on user pain)
- Vague requirements without Epic groupings
- Missing traceability to Project Brief
- Requirements that can't be broken into Epics

### üéØ **Epic Enablement:**

This PRD should enable immediate Epic creation by providing:

- **Numbered requirements** (BR1, BR2, NFR1...) with priorities that Epics can reference
- **Epic groupings** within requirements that map to Epic themes
- **User workflows** that become Epic features
- **Success metrics** that become Epic acceptance criteria
