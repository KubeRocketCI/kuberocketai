# Task: Create Project Charter

## Description

Create a comprehensive project charter that formally authorizes the project and provides the Project Manager with the authority to apply organizational resources to project activities. As defined in PMBoK, the project charter is a document issued by the project initiator or sponsor that formally authorizes the existence of a project and provides the Project Manager with the authority to apply organizational resources to project activities.

## Instructions

<instructions>
Confirm the exact output document you will create using [project-charter-template.md](./.krci-ai/templates/project-charter-template.md) and verify that dependencies declared in the YAML frontmatter are accessible. Do not proceed until initiating inputs (business case, stakeholders, budget/timeline context) are available or explicitly provided.

Reference [project-management-methodology.md](./.krci-ai/data/project-management-methodology.md) for PMBoK standards and charter best practices. Review business case, project request, or initiating documentation to identify project purpose, business need, strategic alignment, high-level scope and deliverables, key stakeholders and their roles, and preliminary success criteria. Identify project sponsor, key decision makers, primary stakeholders and their interests, stakeholder expectations and requirements, and potential resistance or support factors.

Define project purpose and business justification by articulating the problem or opportunity being addressed, establishing strategic alignment with organizational objectives, and documenting expected business value and benefits. Define high-level project scope and boundaries, list major deliverables and milestones, identify what is explicitly excluded from scope, and document assumptions and constraints.

Define measurable project success criteria, establish acceptance criteria for major deliverables, document key performance indicators, and identify quality standards and expectations. Define Project Manager authority and responsibilities, document preliminary resource requirements, establish budget parameters and financial authority, and identify organizational support and governance structure.

Identify high-level project risks and uncertainties, document key assumptions and dependencies, assess potential impact on project success, and outline initial risk mitigation strategies. Document time, cost, and resource constraints, identify regulatory or compliance requirements, note technology or environmental limitations, and address stakeholder or organizational constraints.

Use the [project-charter-template.md](./.krci-ai/templates/project-charter-template.md) for consistent formatting and ensure all required sections are completed thoroughly with appropriate level of detail for charter audience formatted for executive-level review and approval. Review charter with key stakeholders for accuracy, validate alignment with business objectives and strategy, confirm resource commitments and expectations, and ensure all critical elements are addressed.
