# Task: Update Product Requirements Document

## Description

Update an existing PRD with new requirements, scope changes, or refined business needs while maintaining traceability to Project Brief and enabling Epic/Story creation. Focus on change impact assessment and downstream communication to ensure existing Epics and Stories remain aligned with updated requirements.

## Framework Context

**Reference**: [sdlc-framework.md](./.krci-ai/data/common/sdlc-framework.md) - See role responsibilities and artifact flow

## Prerequisites

- [ ] **Existing PRD**: `/docs/prd/prd.md` exists and is properly accessible
- [ ] **Change trigger**: Clear reason for update (Project Brief changes, user research, business priorities, technical constraints, stakeholder feedback)
- [ ] **Stakeholder input**: Understanding of what specifically needs to change and why
- [ ] **Epic/Story review**: Current status of downstream artifacts

## Instructions

1. **Follow SDLC workflow**: Reference [sdlc-framework.md](./.krci-ai/data/common/sdlc-framework.md) for change management process
2. **Use business frameworks**: Apply methodologies from [business-frameworks.md](./.krci-ai/data/business-frameworks.md)
3. **Format output**: Maintain [prd-template.md](./.krci-ai/templates/prd-template.md) structure
4. **Maintain traceability**: Update BR/NFR numbering and assess Epic/Story impact

## Output Format

- **Location**: Updates existing `/docs/prd/prd.md` (EXACT path and filename)
- **Length**: Maintain 6-8 pages maximum
- **Requirements Format**: Maintain BR1, BR2, BR3... and NFR1, NFR2, NFR3... numbering with P0/P1/P2 priority indicators
- **Impact Documentation**: Clear notes on what changed and Epic/Story impact
- **Downstream Updates**: List of Epic/Story artifacts requiring updates

## Success Criteria

- [ ] **File updated** at `/docs/prd/prd.md` reflects all changes
- [ ] **Requirements numbered** BR/NFR structure maintained with priority indicators for Epic mapping
- [ ] **Change documented** clear record of what changed and why
- [ ] **Downstream impact** identified which Epic/Story artifacts need updates
- [ ] **Quality maintained** document remains 6-8 pages maximum
- [ ] **Project Brief alignment** changes align with Project Brief updates (if any)
- [ ] **Stakeholder approval** key stakeholders have approved requirement changes

## Execution Checklist

### Assessment Phase

- [ ] **Change scope**: Identify which sections need updating (Problem/Opportunity, Target Users & Use Cases, Current Journeys/Landscape, Proposed Solution/Elevator Pitch, Goals/Measurable Outcomes, MVP/Functional Requirements)
- [ ] **Impact analysis**: Evaluate how changes affect existing Epics (`/docs/epics/`) and Stories (`/docs/stories/`)
- [ ] **Stakeholder review**: Confirm who needs to approve these changes before implementation
- [ ] **Requirements mapping**: Understand which BR/NFR numbers and priorities are affected

### Requirements Phase

- [ ] **Business requirements**: Update BR1, BR2, BR3... with new business functionality needs
- [ ] **Non-functional requirements**: Update NFR1, NFR2, NFR3... with new system behavior/performance needs
- [ ] **Priority assessment**: Review and update P0/P1/P2 priority indicators as needed
- [ ] **Epic mapping**: Ensure updated requirements can still map to logical Epic groupings

### Update Phase

- [ ] **Section updates**: Modify specific sections using [prd-template.md](./.krci-ai/templates/prd-template.md) structure
- [ ] **Content integration**: Ensure changes are properly integrated without breaking flow
- [ ] **Length verification**: Confirm document remains 6-8 pages maximum
- [ ] **Quality validation**: Verify all changes maintain PRD quality standards

### Change Management Phase

- [ ] **Epic impact assessment**: Determine which Epics (`{epic_number}-epic-{slug}.md`) need updating
- [ ] **Story impact review**: Assess if in-progress Stories (`{epic_number}.{story_number}.story.md`) are affected
- [ ] **Team communication**: Notify Epic owners and development teams of changes
- [ ] **Documentation**: Record change rationale and downstream impact plan

## Change Management Guidelines

### üîÑ **Common Update Scenarios:**

1. **Project Brief Changes**: Update Problem/Opportunity section to align with strategic changes
2. **User Research**: Update Target Users & Use Cases with new insights and behavior patterns
3. **Scope Changes**: Update MVP/Functional Requirements (BR/NFR) with new or modified functionality
4. **Business Priorities**: Update Goals/Measurable Outcomes with revised objectives
5. **Technical Constraints**: Update system requirements (NFR) and priorities based on technical discoveries

### ‚úÖ **Update Best Practices:**

- **Requirement Versioning**: Maintain clear versioning of BR/NFR numbers and priorities for Epic traceability
- **Impact Assessment**: Always evaluate Epic/Story impact before implementing changes
- **Stakeholder Alignment**: Ensure all requirement changes have proper stakeholder approval
- **Documentation**: Maintain clear change history and rationale for all updates
- **Quality Focus**: Keep user needs prioritized over technical implementation details

### ‚ùå **Update Pitfalls to Avoid:**

- Breaking existing BR/NFR numbering that Epics depend on
- Making changes without assessing Epic/Story impact
- Updating without proper stakeholder approval process
- Expanding scope beyond 6-8 page limit during updates
- Missing communication to downstream development teams

### üéØ **Impact Assessment Questions:**

- "Which specific requirements (BR/NFR) and priorities need updating?"
- "How do these changes affect existing Epic feature definitions?"
- "Which in-progress Stories might be impacted by requirement changes?"
- "What's the priority order for communicating changes to development teams?"
- "Do any Epic completion criteria need updating based on PRD changes?"

### üìã **Epic/Story Impact Checklist:**

- [ ] **Epic alignment**: Verify updated requirements can still group into logical Epic themes
- [ ] **Story compatibility**: Check if in-progress Stories remain valid with updated requirements
- [ ] **Development communication**: Notify teams of requirement changes and timeline impact
- [ ] **Completion criteria**: Update Epic/Story acceptance criteria if needed based on PRD changes
