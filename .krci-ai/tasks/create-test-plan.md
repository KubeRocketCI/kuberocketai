# Task: Create Test Plan

## Description

Create comprehensive test plan and strategy for Stories and Epic features, ensuring quality coverage and risk-based testing approach. This task translates Story acceptance criteria and Epic business requirements into systematic testing strategy that validates functionality, performance, and compliance requirements while supporting development quality gates and release readiness.

## Instructions

<instructions>
Confirm the target Stories/Epics and the exact output document you will create using [test-plan.md](./.krci-ai/templates/test-plan.md). Ensure dependencies declared in the YAML frontmatter are accessible, including testing strategy, methodologies, and quality metrics.

Reference [sdlc-framework.md](./.krci-ai/data/krci-ai/core-sdlc-framework.md) for testing workflow and quality gates. Apply approaches from [test-methodologies.md](./.krci-ai/data/test-methodologies.md). Address all Story acceptance criteria and Epic requirements with a risk-based strategy, and define clear entry/exit criteria and success metrics.
</instructions>

## Output Format

Test Plan Documentation - Create comprehensive testing strategy:

- Test plan document: Complete test plan using [test-plan.md](./.krci-ai/templates/test-plan.md) template
- Test strategy: Risk-based testing approach with coverage analysis
- Test scenarios: High-level test scenarios covering all acceptance criteria
- Quality gates: Entry/exit criteria and success metrics for testing phases

## Success Criteria

<success_criteria>
- Test plan completed: Comprehensive test plan document with all required sections
- Coverage validated: All Story acceptance criteria and Epic requirements addressed in testing strategy
- Risk assessed: Testing approach prioritizes high-risk areas and critical functionality
- Resource planned: Testing timeline, effort estimation, and resource requirements defined
- Quality gates established: Clear entry/exit criteria and success metrics for testing phases
- Stakeholder approved: Test plan reviewed and approved by development team and product stakeholders
</success_criteria>

## Execution Checklist

### Requirements Analysis Phase

- Story analysis: Review Story acceptance criteria and identify all testable requirements
- Epic validation: Analyze Epic business requirements and feature scope for testing coverage
- Requirements traceability: Map each acceptance criterion to specific test scenarios
- Risk assessment: Identify high-risk areas requiring comprehensive testing focus

### Test Strategy Development Phase

- Testing approach: Define testing types (functional, integration, performance, security) based on requirements
- Test levels: Determine unit, integration, system, and acceptance testing scope
- Test environments: Specify testing environments and data requirements
- Automation strategy: Identify candidates for test automation vs manual testing

### Test Planning Phase

- Test scenarios creation: Develop high-level test scenarios covering all acceptance criteria using [test-plan.md](./.krci-ai/templates/test-plan.md)
- Resource estimation: Calculate testing effort, timeline, and resource requirements
- Quality gates definition: Establish entry/exit criteria for each testing phase
- Success metrics: Define quality metrics and acceptance thresholds

### Validation and Approval Phase

- Coverage verification: Ensure all Story acceptance criteria and Epic requirements are covered
- Risk mitigation validation: Confirm high-risk areas have appropriate testing focus
- Stakeholder review: Present test plan to development team and product stakeholders
- Plan approval: Obtain formal approval before test case generation and execution

## Content Guidelines

### Test Planning Focus Areas

#### Story-Level Testing (Primary Focus)

- Acceptance Criteria: Map each Story acceptance criterion to specific test scenarios
- Functional Testing: Validate business functionality meets Story requirements
- Edge Cases: Identify boundary conditions and error scenarios
- User Experience: Test user workflows and interaction patterns

#### Epic-Level Testing (Integration Focus)

- Feature Integration: Validate Epic features work together seamlessly
- Business Process: Test end-to-end business workflows across multiple Stories
- Performance Requirements: Address Epic-level performance and scalability needs
- Cross-Story Dependencies: Test interactions between related Stories

### Quality Standards

- Requirements Coverage: All Story acceptance criteria and Epic requirements addressed
- Risk-Based Approach: Testing prioritizes high-risk and critical functionality areas
- Clear Strategy: Testing approach is well-defined with specific methodologies
- Resource Planned: Timeline, effort, and resource requirements are realistic
- Quality Metrics: Success criteria and quality thresholds are measurable
- Stakeholder Aligned: Test plan approved by development and product teams

### Common Pitfalls to Avoid

- Creating test plans without analyzing actual Story acceptance criteria
- Over-engineering test strategy beyond Epic and Story scope
- Missing risk assessment and priority-based testing focus
- Inadequate resource planning and timeline estimation
- Poor traceability between requirements and test scenarios
- Creating test plans that don't align with development workflow

### Epic/Story Testing Integration

This test planning should enable systematic quality assurance by providing:

- Story validation through acceptance criteria-based test scenarios
- Epic verification through integrated feature testing across Stories
- Quality gates that align with development milestones and release readiness
- Risk mitigation through priority-based testing of critical functionality
