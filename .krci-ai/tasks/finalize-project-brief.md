# Task: Finalize Project Brief

## Description

Complete the project brief creation process by ensuring all validations are satisfied, stakeholders have approved content, and the brief meets all quality standards for downstream SDLC artifact creation.

This task may reference [validation frameworks](./.krci-ai/data/validation-frameworks.md) for final quality checks.

## Prerequisites

<prerequisites>
- Project brief exists with validation checkpoints completed
- All required validations completed with satisfactory results
- Stakeholder review and feedback incorporated
- Assumption tracker updated with current status
</prerequisites>

### Reference Assets

Dependencies:

- /docs/prd/project-brief.md (refined brief)
- /docs/prd/brief-validation-*.md (validation reports)
- /docs/prd/brief-assumptions.md (assumption tracker)
- ./.krci-ai/data/krci-ai/core-sdlc-framework.md

## Instructions

<instructions>
Complete the project brief creation process by ensuring all validations are satisfied, stakeholders have approved content, and the brief meets all quality standards for downstream SDLC artifact creation.

### Phase 1: Quality Gate Assessment

Verify all quality gates have been satisfied:

#### Validation Completeness Check

- [ ] All validation checkpoints marked as completed
- [ ] Validation confidence levels meet minimum thresholds
- [ ] Critical assumptions validated with strong evidence
- [ ] High-impact risks assessed and mitigated

#### Stakeholder Approval Verification

- [ ] Key stakeholders have reviewed and approved content
- [ ] Feedback incorporated and documented
- [ ] No blocking concerns remain unaddressed
- [ ] Authorization to proceed to PRD creation obtained

### Phase 2: Final Brief Quality Review

#### Content Quality Assessment

- [ ] Executive summary captures complete project essence
- [ ] Problem statement is specific and evidence-based
- [ ] Target users are clearly defined with validated research
- [ ] Success metrics are measurable with realistic timelines
- [ ] Constraints reflect actual limitations and assumptions
- [ ] Risks identified with appropriate mitigation strategies

#### Technical Quality Check

- [ ] Document length is 2-3 pages maximum
- [ ] File saved exactly as `/docs/prd/project-brief.md`
- [ ] All required sections completed per template
- [ ] Evidence sources properly cited and accessible
- [ ] Validation status clearly documented

### Phase 3: SDLC Readiness Verification

#### Downstream Enablement Check

- Brief provides sufficient context for PRD creation
- Success metrics enable measurable outcomes
- User definitions support Epic and Story creation
- Technical considerations inform Architecture planning
- Business value justifies resource investment

#### Documentation Package Completion

- Project brief finalized and approved
- Supporting validation reports completed
- Assumption tracker current and maintained
- Evidence library documented and accessible
</instructions>

## Output Format

<output_format>
- Primary Output: Final approved `/docs/prd/project-brief.md`
- Status Update: Mark brief status as "APPROVED - Ready for PRD"
- Handoff Package: Complete documentation set for next phase
- Length: 2-3 pages maximum maintained
</output_format>

## Success Criteria

<success_criteria>
- All quality gates satisfied with documented evidence
- Stakeholder approval obtained with sign-off documentation
- Brief quality verified against all template requirements
- SDLC readiness confirmed for downstream artifact creation
- Documentation package complete for PRD development phase
</success_criteria>
