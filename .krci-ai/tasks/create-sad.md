# Task: Create Solution Architecture Document (SAD)

## Description

Create comprehensive Solution Architecture Document that bridges PRD requirements to Epic/Story implementation using enterprise architecture standards with SDLC integration.

## Input Dependencies

- **Required**: PRD document with BR/NFR requirements defined
- **Required**: Epic definitions and business context
- **Optional**: Project Brief for strategic context
- **Optional**: Existing baseline architecture documentation

## Instructions

### Phase 1: Input Analysis

1. **Parse PRD Requirements**
   - Extract all Business Requirements (BR1, BR2, BR3...)
   - Extract all Non-Functional Requirements (NFR1, NFR2, NFR3...)
   - Identify constraints, assumptions, and success criteria

2. **Analyze Epic Context**
   - Understand high-level features and business objectives
   - Note component breakdown requirements
   - Identify Epic-to-Story guidance needs

3. **Review Business Context**
   - Project Brief objectives and success metrics
   - Target users and stakeholder concerns
   - Technology strategy and organizational constraints

### Phase 2: Architecture Document Creation

1. **Use Complete Template**
   - Follow [SAD Template](./.krci-ai/templates/sad-template.md)
   - Complete all 11 sections systematically
   - Replace all template variables with project-specific content

2. **Focus on SDLC Integration**
   - **Section 2.4**: Create PRD Requirements Mapping table
   - **Section 6.8**: Define Solution Strategy with technology decisions
   - **Section 7.3**: Provide Epic Breakdown Guidance for development
   - **Section 8.1**: Use ADR format for architectural decisions

3. **Apply Quality Standards**
   - Use C4 visual hierarchy approach for architectural views
   - Address all quality attributes with implementation strategies
   - Ensure comprehensive risk mitigation strategies
   - Provide actionable development guidance

### Phase 3: SDLC Integration Focus

#### Critical Section 2.4: PRD Requirements Mapping

- Create direct traceability table linking each BR/NFR to architectural components
- Define implementation approach for each requirement
- Ensure no PRD requirement is left unmapped

#### Critical Section 6.8: Solution Strategy

- Document architectural principles driving design decisions
- Define technology stack with clear rationale and trade-offs
- Establish architecture patterns with business justification

#### Critical Section 7.3: Implementation Guidance

- Create Epic Breakdown Guidance table mapping components to Epics
- Define Story creation focus areas for each Epic
- Establish development standards and API design guidelines
- Align testing strategy with quality assurance approach

#### Critical Section 8.1: Architectural Decisions

- Use ADR format for all major architectural decisions
- Include context, decision, consequences, and alternatives
- Ensure decision rationale enables future maintenance

### Phase 4: Quality Validation

1. **Content Completeness Check**
   - All 11 sections completed with relevant content
   - No template variables remaining unfilled
   - Professional tone and technical accuracy maintained

2. **SDLC Integration Verification**
   - PRD requirements fully traced to architectural components
   - Epic breakdown guidance enables immediate Epic creation
   - Development standards and API guidelines provided
   - Quality assurance approach defined

3. **C4 Visual Approach Validation**
   - System Context diagram (C4 Level 1) included
   - Container diagram (C4 Level 2) included
   - Component diagrams (C4 Level 3) for major components
   - Deployment view shows infrastructure mapping

## Templates and References

- **Primary Template**: [SAD Template](./.krci-ai/templates/sad-template.md)
- **Supporting Templates**:
  - [Architecture Decision Record](./.krci-ai/templates/architecture-decision-record.md)
  - [Requirements Mapping](./.krci-ai/templates/requirements-mapping.md)
- **Standards**: [SAD Standards](./.krci-ai/data/sad-standards.md)
- **Guidelines**: [C4 Model Guidelines](./.krci-ai/data/c4-model-guidelines.md)

## Output Format

- **File Name**: `sad-v1.md` (increment version as needed)
- **Location**: `docs/architecture/`
- **Format**: Markdown following SAD template structure
- **Content**: Complete architecture document ready for Epic/Story creation

## Success Criteria

- [ ] Product Owner can create Epics directly from Section 7.3 guidance
- [ ] Developers understand implementation approach from architecture
- [ ] All major technology and design decisions have clear rationale
- [ ] Quality attributes have specific implementation approaches
- [ ] Clear traceability path: PRD → Architecture → Epic → Story

## Quality Gates

- Architecture addresses all PRD requirements (BR and NFR)
- SDLC integration sections (2.4, 6.8, 7.3, 8.1) completed
- Professional architecture standards maintained
- Epic/Story implementation guidance actionable
- C4 visual hierarchy properly implemented

## Common Pitfalls to Avoid

❌ **DON'T:**

- Leave any `{{variable}}` placeholders unfilled
- Copy/paste generic content without project customization
- Skip SDLC integration sections (2.4, 6.8, 7.3, 8.1)
- Create duplicate content between sections
- Use vague or non-specific language
- Ignore PRD requirements traceability

✅ **DO:**

- Customize all content to specific project context
- Create direct PRD-to-architecture traceability
- Provide actionable Epic/Story guidance
- Use professional architecture terminology
- Follow C4 visual hierarchy approach
- Document decisions with clear rationale

## AI Agent Specific Instructions

### Variable Replacement Strategy

1. **System Context**: Extract system name, purpose, and scope from PRD
2. **Requirements Analysis**: Map each BR/NFR to specific architectural decisions
3. **Stakeholder Analysis**: Identify all stakeholders from Project Brief and PRD
4. **Technology Strategy**: Align with organizational standards while meeting requirements
5. **Epic Mapping**: Create actionable guidance for immediate Epic creation

### Quality Validation Steps

1. **Traceability Check**: Every PRD requirement must appear in Section 2.4 mapping
2. **Implementation Check**: Section 7.3 must enable immediate Epic creation
3. **Decision Check**: All major decisions must follow ADR format in Section 8.1
4. **Visual Check**: C4 diagrams must be included in Sections 6.1-6.2
5. **Professional Check**: Enterprise architecture standards maintained throughout

## Expected Timeline

- **Small Systems** (< 5 components): 2-4 hours
- **Medium Systems** (5-15 components): 4-8 hours
- **Large Systems** (15+ components): 8-16 hours

## Risk Mitigation

- **Scope Creep**: Use PRD as definitive requirement source
- **Analysis Paralysis**: Focus on MVP architecture first, iterate later
- **SDLC Disconnect**: Validate Epic guidance with Product Owner
- **Technical Debt**: Address known constraints and technical limitations
- **Stakeholder Alignment**: Validate architectural approach with key stakeholders

This task creates professional, SDLC-integrated architecture documentation that drives successful product development.
