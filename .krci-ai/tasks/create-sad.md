# Task: Create Software Architecture Document (SAD)

## Description

Create comprehensive system architecture documentation that translates PRD requirements and Epic features into technical design specifications for development teams. This SAD enables implementation guidance and provides technical foundation for all development work.

## Prerequisites

- [ ] **Completed PRD**: PRD exists at `/docs/prd/prd.md` with BR/NFR requirements defined
- [ ] **Epic definitions**: Epics available at `/docs/epics/` with business context and scope
- [ ] **Architecture principles**: Understanding of organizational architecture standards
- [ ] **Technology constraints**: Awareness of technology stack and platform limitations

### Reference Assets

Dependencies:

- ./.krci-ai/data/common/sdlc-framework.md
- ./.krci-ai/data/architecture-principles.md
- ./.krci-ai/data/design-patterns.md
- ./.krci-ai/templates/sad-template.md

Validation: Verify all dependencies exist at specified paths before proceeding. HALT if any missing.

## Instructions

1. **Follow SDLC workflow**: Reference [sdlc-framework.md](./.krci-ai/data/common/sdlc-framework.md) for architecture documentation dependencies and quality gates
2. **Apply design principles**: Use guidelines from [architecture-principles.md](./.krci-ai/data/architecture-principles.md) and [design-patterns.md](./.krci-ai/data/design-patterns.md)
3. **Format output**: Use [sad-template.md](./.krci-ai/templates/sad-template.md) for comprehensive structure
4. **Ensure traceability**: Map PRD requirements (BR/NFR) and Epic features to architectural components

## Output Format

**Multi-File Architecture Documentation** - Create numbered section files in `/docs/architecture/` following the structure from [sad-template.md](./.krci-ai/templates/sad-template.md):

### Core Architecture Sections (Required for All Projects)

- [ ] **01-executive-summary.md** - Business context, architectural approach, success metrics
- [ ] **02-introduction.md** - Definitions, scope, stakeholders, **PRD requirements mapping**
- [ ] **06-target-architecture.md** - Target state C4 diagrams, quality attributes, solution strategy
- [ ] **07-transition-migration.md** - Migration approach, roadmap, **Epic breakdown guidance**
- [ ] **08-architectural-decisions.md** - ADR format decisions with context, alternatives, consequences

### Extended Sections (Medium/Large Projects)

- [ ] **03-context.md** - Technology strategy, business/data/infrastructure/application/security architecture
- [ ] **04-requirements.md** - Business goals, functional requirements, NFRs, constraints, assumptions
- [ ] **05-baseline-architecture.md** - Current state conceptual, logical, integration, physical views
- [ ] **09-cross-cutting-concerns.md** - Security, scalability, observability, fault tolerance approaches
- [ ] **10-quality-assurance.md** - Testing strategy, automation approach, quality metrics
- [ ] **11-appendices.md** - Glossary, diagram index, reference materials

**Project Sizing Guidelines:**

- **Small Projects**: Use core 5-file structure (sections 1, 2, 6, 7, 8)
- **Medium Projects**: Use 8-file structure (sections 1, 2, 3, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10)
- **Large Projects**: Use full 11-file structure above

**Template Reference**: Follow comprehensive structure and content guidelines from [sad-template.md](./.krci-ai/templates/sad-template.md)

## Success Criteria

- [ ] **Core sections completed** - Required architecture sections (01-executive-summary.md, 02-introduction.md, 06-target-architecture.md, 07-transition-migration.md, 08-architectural-decisions.md) created with project-specific content
- [ ] **PRD traceability established** - Clear mapping from BR/NFR requirements to architectural components in 02-introduction.md
- [ ] **Epic enablement provided** - Architecture guidance in 07-transition-migration.md enables Epic breakdown and Story creation
- [ ] **Quality attributes addressed** - NFR requirements have specific implementation approaches in 06-target-architecture.md
- [ ] **Technology decisions documented** - All major architectural decisions in 08-architectural-decisions.md using ADR format
- [ ] **Professional quality maintained** - All sections follow template structure from [sad-template.md](./.krci-ai/templates/sad-template.md)
- [ ] **Project-appropriate scope** - Section count matches project complexity (5 for small, 8 for medium, 11 for large projects)

## Execution Checklist

### Discovery Phase

- [ ] **PRD analysis**: Extract all BR/NFR requirements and identify architectural implications
- [ ] **Epic review**: Understand business features and component breakdown needs
- [ ] **Stakeholder requirements**: Identify architectural concerns from business stakeholders
- [ ] **Technology constraints**: Review organizational standards and platform limitations

### Architecture Design Phase

- [ ] **System context**: Define system boundaries and external interfaces
- [ ] **Component architecture**: Design high-level system components and their interactions
- [ ] **Quality attributes**: Address NFR requirements with specific architectural approaches
- [ ] **Technology decisions**: Select technology stack aligned with requirements and standards

### Documentation Phase

- [ ] **SAD creation**: Use [sad-template.md](./.krci-ai/templates/sad-template.md) structure
- [ ] **Variable population**: Complete all template variables with project-specific content
- [ ] **Requirements mapping**: Ensure every BR/NFR requirement is addressed in architecture
- [ ] **Epic guidance**: Provide implementation guidance for Epic breakdown and Story creation

### Validation Phase

- [ ] **Completeness check**: Verify all 11 sections are populated and professional
- [ ] **Consistency validation**: Ensure architecture decisions align across all sections
- [ ] **Traceability verification**: Confirm all PRD requirements map to architectural components
- [ ] **Implementation readiness**: Validate architecture provides sufficient development guidance

## Content Guidelines

### üìã **SAD Template Sections (11 Required):**

1. **Executive Summary**: Business-focused overview connecting architecture to business value
2. **Introduction**: Foundation and context for architectural decisions
3. **Context**: Business context, stakeholders, and external dependencies
4. **Requirements**: Detailed BR/NFR requirements analysis and architectural implications
5. **Baseline Architecture**: Current state and existing system components
6. **Target Architecture**: Desired future state and new system design
7. **Transition/Migration**: Implementation approach and migration strategy
8. **Architectural Decisions**: Key technical decisions with rationale and alternatives
9. **Cross-Cutting Concerns**: Security, logging, monitoring, and other system-wide concerns
10. **Quality Assurance**: Testing strategy and quality validation approaches
11. **Appendices**: Supporting documentation and reference materials

### ‚úÖ **Quality Standards:**

- **Requirements Traceable**: Every BR/NFR requirement addressed in architecture
- **Epic Enabling**: Architecture provides clear guidance for Epic implementation
- **Professional Quality**: Document suitable for stakeholder review and development use
- **Technology Aligned**: Architecture decisions align with organizational standards
- **Implementation Ready**: Sufficient detail for development team implementation

### ‚ùå **Common Pitfalls to Avoid:**

- Leaving template variables unfilled ({{variable}} placeholders)
- Missing requirements traceability from PRD to architecture
- Over-engineering solutions beyond PRD/Epic requirements
- Insufficient implementation guidance for development teams
- Architectural decisions without clear rationale or alternatives

### üéØ **Implementation Enablement:**

This SAD should enable immediate development by providing:

- **Clear component boundaries** that Epics and Stories can implement
- **Technology guidance** that development teams can follow
- **Quality requirements** that become Story acceptance criteria
- **Implementation roadmap** that guides Epic sequencing and Story creation
