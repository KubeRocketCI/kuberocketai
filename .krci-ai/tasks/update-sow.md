# Task: Update Scope of Work (SOW)

## Description

Update an existing Scope of Work document to reflect approved scope changes, refined requirements, or new project information while maintaining SOW integrity as the definitive scope baseline. SOW updates follow formal change control processes to ensure stakeholder alignment and project success.

## Instructions

<instructions>
Confirm existing SOW document is available for modification, approved change request or scope modification exists, impact assessment is completed, stakeholder approval for changes is obtained, and change control board authorization is received (if applicable). Ensure dependencies declared in the YAML frontmatter ([project-management-methodology.md](./.krci-ai/data/project-management-methodology.md) and [sow-template.md](./.krci-ai/templates/sow-template.md)) are readable along with change request documentation before proceeding.

Analyze approved change requests thoroughly. Identify specific SOW sections requiring modification. Assess impact on deliverables, timeline, and resources. Evaluate effect on project success criteria. Review impact on work breakdown structure. Assess changes to task dependencies and sequencing. Evaluate resource allocation and timeline adjustments. Identify cascading effects on other project elements.
</instructions>

## SOW Revision Process

Content Updates:
- Modify affected deliverables and acceptance criteria
- Update work breakdown structure and activities

- Adjust resource requirements and assignments
- Update assumptions, constraints, and exclusions

Consistency Validation:
- Ensure all SOW sections remain aligned
- Verify deliverable dependencies are maintained
- Confirm resource assignments are realistic
- Validate timeline adjustments are achievable

### 3. Stakeholder Coordination

Review Management:

- Present scope modifications with clear rationale
- Gather feedback and address stakeholder concerns
- Obtain formal approval for SOW updates

Change Communication:
- Communicate scope changes to all affected parties

- Notify stakeholders of timeline or resource impacts
- Document change approval and implementation decisions
