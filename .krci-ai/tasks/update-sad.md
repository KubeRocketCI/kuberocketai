# Task: Update Solution Architecture Document (SAD)

## Description

Update existing Solution Architecture Document to incorporate new requirements, technology changes, or architectural decisions while maintaining SDLC integration and traceability.

## Input Dependencies

- **Required**: Existing SAD document to be updated
- **Required**: Change requirements (new PRD requirements, Epic changes, or technical constraints)
- **Optional**: Updated Project Brief or business context
- **Optional**: New technology standards or organizational constraints

## Instructions

### Phase 1: Change Analysis

1. **Identify Change Scope**
   - Analyze new PRD requirements (BR/NFR additions or modifications)
   - Identify Epic changes affecting architectural components
   - Review technology stack updates or organizational policy changes
   - Assess impact on existing architectural decisions

2. **Impact Assessment**
   - Map changes to affected SAD sections
   - Identify downstream impacts on Epic/Story guidance
   - Assess risk implications of proposed changes
   - Determine if changes require new architectural decisions

3. **Stakeholder Impact Review**
   - Review changes with affected stakeholders
   - Validate business context and technical constraints
   - Ensure alignment with organizational strategy

### Phase 2: Architecture Document Updates

#### Section-Specific Update Guidelines

**Section 2.4: PRD Requirements Mapping**

- Add new BR/NFR requirements to traceability table
- Update existing requirement mappings if implementation approach changes
- Ensure all new requirements have architectural component assignments
- Update implementation approaches for modified requirements

**Section 6.8: Solution Strategy**

- Update architectural principles if organizational standards change
- Revise technology decisions for new technical requirements
- Modify architecture patterns based on new business needs
- Update rationale and trade-offs for changed decisions

**Section 7.3: Implementation Guidance**

- Update Epic Breakdown Guidance for new architectural components
- Modify Story creation focus areas based on new requirements
- Revise development standards for new technology adoptions
- Update testing alignment for new quality requirements

**Section 8.1: Architectural Decisions**

- Create new ADRs for significant architectural changes
- Update existing ADR status (supersede decisions if needed)
- Document rationale for all architectural modifications
- Assess alternatives for new technology or pattern adoptions

### Phase 3: SDLC Integration Updates

#### Critical Update Areas

1. **Requirements Traceability Maintenance**
   - Ensure all new PRD requirements mapped to architectural components
   - Validate existing requirement mappings remain accurate
   - Update component responsibilities for new requirements

2. **Epic/Story Guidance Refresh**
   - Update Epic breakdown guidance for new components
   - Modify Story creation focus for changed requirements
   - Revise development standards for new technologies
   - Update testing strategies for new quality attributes

3. **Visual Architecture Updates**
   - Update C4 Context diagrams for new external systems
   - Modify Container diagrams for new architectural components
   - Revise Component diagrams for internal changes
   - Update deployment views for infrastructure changes

### Phase 4: Quality Validation

1. **Change Completeness Check**
   - All requested changes incorporated into SAD
   - No orphaned requirements or components
   - Updated sections maintain internal consistency
   - Professional documentation standards maintained

2. **SDLC Integration Verification**
   - Updated Epic breakdown guidance enables immediate Epic modification
   - Development standards reflect new technology decisions
   - Quality assurance approach updated for new requirements
   - Testing alignment maintained with architectural changes

3. **Impact Assessment Validation**
   - Downstream Epic/Story impacts documented
   - Risk mitigation strategies updated for new changes
   - Stakeholder concerns addressed in updated sections

- **Content**: Updated architecture document with change traceability

## Success Criteria

- [ ] All requested changes incorporated accurately
- [ ] Updated Epic guidance enables immediate Epic modification
- [ ] New architectural decisions properly documented with ADRs
- [ ] SDLC integration sections maintain actionable guidance
- [ ] Change impact clearly documented and communicated

## Quality Gates

- Change requirements fully addressed in relevant SAD sections
- New architectural decisions follow ADR format

- Professional documentation standards maintained
- Stakeholder validation completed for significant changes

## Common Update Scenarios

### New Requirements Addition

1. Add requirements to Section 2.4 mapping table
2. Update affected components in Section 6.8
3. Create Epic guidance in Section 7.3
4. Document decisions in Section 8.1 ADRs

### Technology Stack Changes

1. Update technology decisions in Section 6.8
2. Create ADR for technology change rationale
3. Update development standards in Section 7.3
4. Assess integration impacts in Section 6.3

### Organizational Policy Updates

1. Update constraints and assumptions in Section 4
2. Modify architectural principles in Section 6.8
3. Update cross-cutting concerns in Section 9

## Risk Mitigation for Updates

- **Version Control**: Maintain clear version history with change rationale
- **Impact Communication**: Notify affected teams of Epic/Story guidance changes
- **Validation Cycles**: Review updates with Product Owner and Development teams
- **Rollback Planning**: Document changes to enable reversal if needed
- **Change Approval**: Ensure significant architectural changes have stakeholder approval

This task maintains architectural documentation quality while enabling agile response to changing requirements and technology landscapes.
