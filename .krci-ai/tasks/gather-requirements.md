# Task: Gather Requirements

## Description

Systematically gather and analyze business requirements from stakeholders to enhance PRD with detailed workflows and acceptance criteria for Epic/Story creation. This task bridges stakeholder needs with technical implementation through structured elicitation techniques, ensuring all business requirements (BR) and system requirements (NFR) are comprehensively captured and documented for development guidance.

## Prerequisites

- [ ] **PRD foundation**: Initial PRD exists at `/docs/prd/prd.md` with basic business context
- [ ] **Stakeholder access**: Identified stakeholders available for engagement sessions
- [ ] **Analysis tools**: Requirements documentation tools and templates prepared
- [ ] **Business context**: Project scope and objectives defined from Project Brief

### Reference Assets

Dependencies:

- ./.krci-ai/data/common/sdlc-framework.md
- ./.krci-ai/data/analysis-methodologies.md
- ./.krci-ai/templates/requirements-doc.md

Validation: Verify all dependencies exist at specified paths before proceeding. HALT if any missing.

## Instructions

1. **Follow SDLC workflow**: Reference [sdlc-framework.md](./.krci-ai/data/common/sdlc-framework.md) for requirements gathering dependencies and workflow
2. **Apply analysis methodologies**: Use techniques from [analysis-methodologies.md](./.krci-ai/data/analysis-methodologies.md)
3. **Format output**: Use [requirements-doc.md](./.krci-ai/templates/requirements-doc.md) for documentation
4. **Enhance PRD**: Refine existing PRD with detailed BR/NFR requirements and stakeholder insights

## Output Format

**Enhanced Requirements Documentation** - Update existing PRD and create supporting documents:

- [ ] **Updated `/docs/prd/prd.md`** - Enhanced with detailed BR/NFR requirements, acceptance criteria, and stakeholder insights
- [ ] **Requirements traceability** - Clear mapping from business needs to solution requirements
- [ ] **Stakeholder validation records** - Documented approval and sign-off from key stakeholders
- [ ] **Epic enablement guidance** - Requirements structured to support Epic/Story breakdown

## Success Criteria

- [ ] **PRD enhanced** - All gathered requirements integrated into PRD with BR/NFR format
- [ ] **Stakeholder consensus** - All key stakeholders engaged and requirements validated
- [ ] **Requirements completeness** - Functional and non-functional requirements comprehensively documented
- [ ] **Acceptance criteria defined** - Clear, testable criteria provided for all requirements
- [ ] **Epic readiness** - Requirements structured to enable Epic creation and Story breakdown
- [ ] **Traceability established** - Clear links from business needs to solution requirements

## Execution Checklist

### Stakeholder Engagement Phase

- [ ] **Stakeholder identification**: Map all relevant business stakeholders, decision makers, and subject matter experts
- [ ] **Engagement strategy**: Define interview approaches, workshop plans, and collaboration methods
- [ ] **Session scheduling**: Coordinate discovery sessions, interviews, and validation meetings
- [ ] **Preparation materials**: Prepare interview guides, questionnaires, and elicitation templates

### Requirements Elicitation Phase

- [ ] **Structured interviews**: Conduct one-on-one sessions with key stakeholders using [requirements-doc.md](./.krci-ai/templates/requirements-doc.md) format
- [ ] **Collaborative workshops**: Facilitate group sessions for complex requirement areas
- [ ] **Process observation**: Analyze current workflows and business processes for requirement insights
- [ ] **Documentation review**: Examine existing policies, procedures, and system documentation

### Requirements Documentation Phase

- [ ] **BR/NFR categorization**: Organize requirements using Business Requirements (BR1, BR2...) and Non-Functional Requirements (NFR1, NFR2...) format
- [ ] **Acceptance criteria definition**: Create specific, measurable criteria for each requirement
- [ ] **Business justification**: Document rationale and business value for each requirement
- [ ] **PRD integration**: Update `/docs/prd/prd.md` with enhanced requirements and stakeholder insights

### Validation and Approval Phase

- [ ] **Stakeholder review**: Present documented requirements to stakeholders for validation
- [ ] **Requirements confirmation**: Obtain formal approval and sign-off from business stakeholders
- [ ] **Traceability verification**: Ensure all business needs are addressed in solution requirements
- [ ] **Epic preparation**: Structure requirements to enable immediate Epic creation and Story breakdown

## Content Guidelines

### üéØ **Requirements Structure (BR/NFR Format):**

#### **Business Requirements (BR):**

- **BR1**: [Primary business capability requirement]
- **BR2**: [Secondary business process requirement]
- **BR3**: [Stakeholder workflow requirement]

#### **Non-Functional Requirements (NFR):**

- **NFR1**: [Performance/scalability requirement]
- **NFR2**: [Security/compliance requirement]
- **NFR3**: [Usability/accessibility requirement]

### ‚úÖ **Quality Standards:**

- **Stakeholder Validated**: All requirements reviewed and approved by business stakeholders
- **Acceptance Criteria**: Each requirement has specific, testable acceptance criteria
- **Business Justified**: Clear business rationale and value provided for each requirement
- **Epic Enabled**: Requirements structured to support Epic breakdown and Story creation
- **Traceable**: Clear links from business needs to solution requirements established

### ‚ùå **Common Pitfalls to Avoid:**

- Documenting solutions instead of requirements
- Missing non-functional requirements (NFR)
- Inadequate stakeholder engagement and validation
- Ambiguous or untestable acceptance criteria
- Poor requirements categorization and organization
- Lack of business justification for requirements

### üéØ **Epic Enablement Focus:**

This requirements gathering should enable immediate Epic creation by providing:

- **Clear business capabilities** that translate into Epic features
- **Acceptance criteria** that become Epic acceptance criteria and Story requirements
- **Stakeholder insights** that inform Epic priorities and implementation sequencing
- **Requirements traceability** that connects Epics back to business needs and stakeholder value
