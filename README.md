AI-as-Code framework for structuring AI-assisted software development. Define AI agents as version-controlled Markdown files with YAML frontmatter.

## Problem

You've figured out how to make AI agents understand your project. You've crafted the perfect prompts, built context-aware agents, and your AI-generated code actually works. **Now what?**

The real challenge isn't creating smart agents‚Äîit's **scaling that success** across your team, projects, and workflow.

### What Happens When It Actually Works

- **"How do I share this with my team?"** - You've spent weeks perfecting an agent configuration, but there's no clean way to distribute it beyond copy-pasting prompts in Slack
- **"Which version was working?"** - Your agent setup evolved over time, but when something breaks, you can't roll back to the version that was working last week
- **"I need this in my IDE, not just ChatGPT"** - Your perfect brainstorming agent lives in a web interface, but you need it integrated into your actual development workflow
- **"Can we run this in CI?"** - Your agents work great for interactive development, but you need them for code review, documentation generation, and automated analysis
- **"How do we maintain this across 10 repositories?"** - Each project needs slight variations, but managing separate configurations becomes a nightmare

### The Scaling Problem

- **No Distribution System**: Agents remain isolated to individuals or require manual sharing through ad-hoc methods
- **Version Control Gap**: Agent configurations evolve without proper versioning, making it impossible to track what works and what doesn't
- **Platform Lock-in**: Agents tied to specific tools can't be moved, adapted, or integrated into different parts of your workflow
- **Maintenance Overhead**: As your agent library grows, keeping configurations synchronized across projects becomes unmanageable
- **Quality Assurance**: No systematic way to validate that agents work correctly before deploying them across teams or into production workflows
- **Context Fragmentation**: Web-based AI tools lose critical project context, forcing manual re-explanation of architecture, patterns, and organizational standards for each interaction

## Solution

KubeRocketAI brings the proven **"Infrastructure-as-Code" model to AI agent management**. Teams define agents in version-controlled Markdown files that integrate seamlessly with existing development workflows, enabling the same declarative approach developers expect from modern CI/CD pipelines.

## Video Overview

For a practical case study on product development with project-specific AI agent customization, see:

**[Feature Implementation with KubeRocketAI: From Product Requirements to Code in Production (YouTube)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Prr__elEI9A&ab_channel=ThePlatformTeam)**

This video demonstrates how KubeRocketAI applies AI-as-Code principles to deliver local agent components tailored to project needs while maintaining organizational standards. It covers the full journey from product strategy and requirements updates to technical implementation and validation. You'll see how teams can systematically manage agent customization, update PRDs, define epics and stories, and implement solutions using the framework and CLI tools.

### Key Value Propositions

1. **Agent-as-Code Distribution**: Version-control and share your proven agent configurations just like you do with Infrastructure-as-Code
2. **Multi-Platform Injection**: Deploy the same agent definition to your IDE, CI pipeline, bundled for brainstorming, or wherever you need AI assistance
3. **Built-in Validation**: Validate agent configurations and dependencies before deployment, ensuring consistent behavior across environments
4. **Context-Preserving Bundling**: Package agents with full project context for web chat tools, maintaining architectural knowledge and organizational standards across platforms
5. **Scalable Team Workflows**: Maintain agent libraries across multiple projects and repositories without configuration hell

## Smart Context Bundling

**Two deployment modes for different contexts:**

### IDE Integration: Limited, Focused Context

Deploy agents directly into your development environment with project-specific context optimized for coding tasks.

### Web Chat: Full Context for Strategic Work

Bundle agents with complete project assets for brainstorming and requirements elicitation in high-context models (ChatGPT, Claude, Gemini Pro).

```bash
# IDE: Focused development context
krci-ai install --ide=cursor

# Web Chat: Complete project context for strategic sessions
krci-ai bundle --all --output brainstorm-context.md
```
