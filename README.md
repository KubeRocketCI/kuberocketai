# KubeRocketAI

AI-as-Code framework for structuring AI-assisted software development. Define AI agents as version-controlled Markdown files with YAML frontmatter.

## Problem

You've figured out how to make AI agents understand your project. You've crafted the perfect prompts, built context-aware agents, and your AI-generated code actually works. **Now what?**

The real challenge isn't creating smart agents‚Äîit's **scaling that success** across your team, projects, and workflow.

### What Happens When It Actually Works

- **"How do I share this with my team?"** - You've spent weeks perfecting an agent configuration, but there's no clean way to distribute it beyond copy-pasting prompts in Slack
- **"Which version was working?"** - Your agent setup evolved over time, but when something breaks, you can't roll back to the version that was working last week
- **"I need this in my IDE, not just ChatGPT"** - Your perfect brainstorming agent lives in a web interface, but you need it integrated into your actual development workflow
- **"Can we run this in CI?"** - Your agents work great for interactive development, but you need them for code review, documentation generation, and automated analysis
- **"How do we maintain this across 10 repositories?"** - Each project needs slight variations, but managing separate configurations becomes a nightmare

### The Scaling Problem

- **No Distribution System**: Agents remain isolated to individuals or require manual sharing through ad-hoc methods
- **Version Control Gap**: Agent configurations evolve without proper versioning, making it impossible to track what works and what doesn't
- **Platform Lock-in**: Agents tied to specific tools can't be moved, adapted, or integrated into different parts of your workflow
- **Maintenance Overhead**: As your agent library grows, keeping configurations synchronized across projects becomes unmanageable
- **Quality Assurance**: No systematic way to validate that agents work correctly before deploying them across teams or into production workflows
- **Context Fragmentation**: Web-based AI tools lose critical project context, forcing manual re-explanation of architecture, patterns, and organizational standards for each interaction

## Solution

KubeRocketAI brings the proven **"Infrastructure-as-Code" model to AI agent management**. Teams define agents in version-controlled Markdown files that integrate seamlessly with existing development workflows, enabling the same declarative approach developers expect from modern CI/CD pipelines.

### Key Value Propositions

1. **Agent-as-Code Distribution**: Version-control and share your proven agent configurations just like you do with Infrastructure-as-Code
2. **Multi-Platform Injection**: Deploy the same agent definition to your IDE, CI pipeline, bundled for brainstorming, or wherever you need AI assistance
3. **Built-in Validation**: Validate agent configurations and dependencies before deployment, ensuring consistent behavior across environments
4. **Context-Preserving Bundling**: Package agents with full project context for web chat tools, maintaining architectural knowledge and organizational standards across platforms
5. **Scalable Team Workflows**: Maintain agent libraries across multiple projects and repositories without configuration hell

## Smart Context Bundling

**Two deployment modes for different contexts:**

### IDE Integration: Limited, Focused Context

Deploy agents directly into your development environment with project-specific context optimized for coding tasks.

### Web Chat: Full Context for Strategic Work

Bundle agents with complete project assets for brainstorming and requirements elicitation in high-context models (ChatGPT, Claude, Gemini Pro).

```bash
# IDE: Focused development context
krci-ai install --ide=cursor

# Web Chat: Complete project context for strategic sessions
krci-ai bundle --all --output brainstorm-context.md
```
