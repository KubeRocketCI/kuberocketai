Feature: Promote applications added using Import strategy GitLab  Scenario Outline: Promote application with deploy-with-autotests pipeline using autotests    Given User creates semver codebase on

<pipelineName> deployment flow    When User opens <pipelineName> deployment flow    And User opens <stageName> stage    Then User sees success status for <stageName> stage    When User deploys <applicationName> application with saved image version    Then User checks deploy pipeline status for <stageName> stage in <pipelineName> pipeline with deploy-with-autotests trigger template    And User checks autotests-maven autotest pipeline status for "<stageName>" stage in "<pipelineName>" pipeline    And User waits till <applicationName> application for <stageName> stage in <pipelineName> pipeline will be deployed with success status    And User checks IMAGE_VERSION promoted image for <applicationName> application for <stageName> stage <pipelineName> pipeline    And User checks that IMAGE_VERSION promoted image available in image stream version popup for <applicationName> application    And User uninstalls <applicationName> application    And User deletes <pipelineName> cd
