Feature: Links to the components gitlab  Scenario Outline: Redirect to the components from the created codebase    Given User opens KubeRocketCI as default user    When User deletes <applicationName> Sonar project if present    When User opens Components tab    And User creates codebase using default versioning type on gitlab      | applicationName   | <applicationName>   |      | codeLanguage      | <codeLanguage>      |      | defaultBranchName | <defaultBranchName> |    When User receive and save GitLab project ID for project <applicationName>    And User select created application <applicationName> name    Then User checks redirect to the sonar in <applicationName> application    And User checks redirect to the current git server for <defaultBranchName> branch in <applicationName> application    When User creates new branch with default versioning type in <applicationName> application      | newBranchName | new |    Then User checks redirect to the current git server for new branch in <applicationName> application    And User deletes new branch    And User deletes application with name <applicationName>    And User deletes gitlab fork project    @UI @TektonGitlabUI    Examples:      | applicationName      | codeLanguage       | defaultBranchName |      | p38-lib-comp-link-gl | python_3_8_library | master            |  Scenario Outline: Redirect to the components from the created cd pipeline    Given User opens KubeRocketCI as default user    When User deletes <applicationName> Sonar project if present    When User opens Components tab    And User creates codebase using default versioning type on gitlab      | applicationName   | <applicationName>   |      | codeLanguage      | <codeLanguage>      |      | defaultBranchName | <defaultBranchName> |    And User opens Deployment Flows tab    And User creates cd pipeline <pipelineName>      | applicationName | <applicationName>   |      | branchName      | <defaultBranchName> |      | clusterName     | in-cluster          |      | stageName       | <stageName>         |    And User waits till <pipelineName> pipeline with <stageName> stage will be created    And User opens Deployment Flows tab    Then User sees success status for <pipelineName> deployment flow    When User opens <pipelineName> deployment flow    Then User checks redirect to the argocd for <pipelineName> pipeline with <stageName> stage    And User checks redirect to the grafana for <pipelineName> pipeline with <stageName> stage    And User checks redirect to the kibana for <pipelineName> pipeline with <stageName> stage    When User opens <stageName> stage    Then User checks redirect from the stage to the argocd for <pipelineName> pipeline with <stageName> stage    And User checks redirect from the stage to the grafana for <pipelineName> pipeline with <stageName> stage    And User checks redirect from the stage to the kibana for <pipelineName> pipeline with <stageName> stage    And User deletes <pipelineName> cd pipeline    And User deletes application with name <applicationName>    And User checks default namespace for <stageName> stage in <pipelineName> pipeline is deleted    @UI @TektonGitlabUI    Examples:      | applicationName             | codeLanguage              | pipelineName  | stageName | defaultBranchName |      | java17gr-app-pipeline-links | java17_gradle_application | java17gr-pipe | dev       | main              |
