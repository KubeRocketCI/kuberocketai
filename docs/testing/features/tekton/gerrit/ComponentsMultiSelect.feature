Feature: Components multi select Gerrit  Scenario Outline: Components multi select deletion    Given User opens KubeRocketCI as default user    When User deletes <applicationName> Sonar project if present    When User opens Components tab    And User clones codebase using semver versioning type on gerrit      | applicationName   | <autotestName>         |      | codeLanguage      | <autotestCodeLanguage> |      | defaultBranchName | <defaultBranchName>    |      | startFromVersion  | 1.2.3                  |      | startFromSnapshot | SNAPSHOT               |    Then User sees success status and correct values in fields for <autotestName> application      | codeLanguage | <autotestCodeLanguage> |    When User clones codebase using semver versioning type on gerrit      | applicationName   | <applicationName>   |      | codeLanguage      | <codeLanguage>      |      | defaultBranchName | <defaultBranchName> |      | startFromVersion  | 1.2.3               |      | startFromSnapshot | SNAPSHOT            |    Then User sees success status and correct values in fields for <applicationName> application      | codeLanguage | <codeLanguage> |    And User opens Deployment Flows tab    And User creates cd pipeline <pipelineName>      | applicationName           | <applicationName>     |      | branchName                | <defaultBranchName>   |      | clusterName               | in-cluster            |      | stageName                 | <stageName>           |      | qualityGatesName          | autotest              |      | qualityGatesProject       | <autotestName>        |      | qualityGatesProjectBranch | <defaultBranchName>   |      | triggerTemplate           | deploy-with-autotests |    And User waits till <pipelineName> pipeline with <stageName> stage will be created    And User opens Deployment Flows tab    Then User sees success status for <pipelineName> deployment flow    When User opens Components tab    And User searches created application by java8-grd-multi name    And User presses multi select button    Then User checks that 2 components are selected    When User presses delete selected components button    Then User checks expected cannot delete popup data      | componentName     | conflictingPipelines | conflictingStage           |      | <applicationName> | <pipelineName>       |                            |      | <autotestName>    |                      | <pipelineName>-<stageName> |    When User opens Deployment Flows tab    Then User deletes <pipelineName> cd pipeline    When User opens Components tab    And User searches created application by java8-grd-multi name    And User presses multi select button    Then User checks that 2 components are selected    When User presses delete selected components button    Then User confirms components deletion    And User searches created application by java8-grd-multi name    And User checks that selected applications are deleted      | <applicationName> | <autotestName> |    @UI @TektonGerritUI @TektonGerritMultiSelectUI @TektonGerritDeployUI    Examples:      | applicationName     | defaultBranchName | codeLanguage             | pipelineName    | stageName | autotestName                | autotestCodeLanguage  |      | java8-grd-multi-app | master            | java8_gradle_application | java8-grd-multi | dev       | java8-grd-multi-select-test | java8_gradle_autotest |
