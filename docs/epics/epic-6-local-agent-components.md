## Overview

### Problem Statement

Teams need project-specific customizations for AI agents without losing access to organizational standards and shared agent definitions. Current system forces teams to choose between organizational governance and project-specific workflows, creating productivity barriers and inconsistent agent usage patterns across 80% of development teams.

### Goal

Enable seamless local agent component customization for 90% of development teams within 1 sprint of adoption, reducing project-specific agent setup time from 2 hours to under 5 minutes while maintaining organizational governance and shared agent ecosystem compatibility.

### Target Users

Primary: Development Teams (70%) - implementing project-specific agent workflows and customizations
Secondary: Technical Leads (20%) - defining team standards and component strategies
Tertiary: DevOps Engineers (10%) - managing component deployment and organizational governance

## Scope

### What's Included

1. Local component directory structure at `.krci-ai/local/` with tasks, templates, and data subdirectories (BR9)
2. Priority-based component resolution system with local override capabilities (NFR6)
3. Component discovery and loading mechanisms within 1-second performance requirement (NFR6)
4. Cross-reference resolution for local component dependencies and validation
5. Component source logging and debugging capabilities for troubleshooting
6. Documentation and examples for independent local component creation

### What's Not Included

1. Advanced component versioning and migration tools (deferred to future Epic)
2. Component conflict resolution beyond simple local-over-global priority (out of MVP scope)
3. Cross-project component sharing mechanisms (future roadmap consideration)
4. Component performance analytics and optimization tools (deferred to monitoring Epic)
5. GUI-based component management interface (command-line focused for MVP)

### Dependencies

Epic Dependencies:

- Epic 1: KubeRocketAI Baseline (foundation infrastructure and installation system)
- Epic 2: Core Engine (agent processing capabilities and validation framework)

System Dependencies:

- File system access for `.krci-ai/local/` directory operations
- Python component loading and validation framework
- Logging infrastructure for component source tracking

External Dependencies:

- Development team training on local component creation patterns
- Documentation platform for component examples and best practices

## Technical Implementation

### Directory Structure

```bash
{project_root}/
├── .krci-ai/
│   ├── local/                  # Local components (project-specific)
│   │   ├── tasks/              # Custom task definitions
│   │   ├── templates/          # Custom output templates
│   │   └── data/               # Custom data sources
│   ├── agents/                 # Global agents (from installation)
│   ├── tasks/                  # Global tasks
│   ├── templates/              # Global templates
│   └── data/                   # Global data
```

### Component Resolution Logic

1. **Discovery Phase**: Scan both global and local directories
2. **Priority Phase**: Local components override global with same filename
3. **Loading Phase**: Load final component set with local precedence
4. **Execution Phase**: Use resolved components during agent execution

### Performance Requirements

System Dependencies:

- File system access for `.krci-ai/local/` directory operations
- Python component loading and validation framework
- Logging infrastructure for component source tracking

External Dependencies:

- Development team training on local component creation patterns
- Documentation platform for component examples and best practices

## Solution Approach

Implementation Strategy:

1. Extend existing component discovery mechanism to scan both global and local directories
2. Implement priority-based resolution with local components taking absolute precedence
3. Leverage existing validation framework for local component structure compliance
4. Enhance logging system to track component source during resolution and execution

Technical Approach:

- Component Discovery: File system scanning with efficient caching for performance
- Priority Resolution: Name-based matching with local-first resolution algorithm
- Validation Framework: Reuse existing component validation for consistency
- Performance Optimization: Lazy loading and directory scanning within 1-second requirement

## User Stories

Planned Stories for Implementation:

### Phase 1: Local Component Override System (Sprint 1)

- Story 6.01: Local Component Override System
  - As a Development Team member with project-specific requirements, I want to store and use local agent components that automatically override global ones, so that I can customize project workflows while maintaining organizational standards
  - Acceptance: Local components in `.krci-ai/local/` take priority over global components with same names, discovery completes within 1 second, and cross-reference resolution works without conflicts
  - Dependencies: Epic 1 (Agent framework), Epic 2 (Core engine and validation system)

## Acceptance Criteria

1. System discovers local components in `.krci-ai/local/{tasks,templates,data}/` directory structure within 1 second
   - Validation: Local component discovery scan completes within 1 second
   - Method: Framework's existing validation ensures defined local files exist and are accessible

2. Local components take absolute priority over global components with same name during resolution
   - Validation: Priority resolution selects local over global for duplicate names
   - Method: Framework's component loading validates local precedence during agent execution

3. Local directory structure mirrors global component organization with consistent naming
   - Validation: Local components follow same naming conventions and file formats
   - Method: Framework's existing file validation checks local component structure compliance

4. Local components can reference other local components without resolution conflicts
   - Validation: Cross-reference resolution works within local component scope
   - Method: Framework's dependency validation ensures local component references resolve correctly

5. Component resolution logging clearly identifies source (local vs global) for debugging
   - Validation: Log output clearly identifies source of each loaded component
   - Method: Framework's existing logging infrastructure shows component source during execution

6. Documentation and examples enable teams to create local components independently
   - Validation: Documentation includes structure guide and working examples
   - Method: Framework's validation confirms example components load without errors

### Component Performance Standards

- Discovery and resolution within 1 second
- Minimal memory overhead for component indexing
- Efficient file system scanning for local components

## Risks & Mitigation

**Risk**: Local components break when global components are updated
**Mitigation**: Version compatibility warnings and local component validation

**Risk**: Teams create inconsistent local components
**Mitigation**: Documentation and best practices for local component creation

**Risk**: Performance degradation with many local components
**Mitigation**: Efficient discovery algorithms and component caching
