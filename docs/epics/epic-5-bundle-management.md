## Overview

### Problem Statement

Developers frequently use web-based AI tools (ChatGPT, Gemini Pro, Claude Web) for quick consultations but lose critical project context, organizational standards, and agent configurations. Current workflow requires manual copying of agent definitions and dependencies across platforms, leading to fragmented AI assistance that doesn't align with project-specific rules, patterns, and architectural standards. This context loss results in 60% of web-based AI interactions producing generic responses that require significant manual adaptation, reducing productivity gains from AI-enhanced development workflows.

### Goal

Enable seamless agent bundling and web chat integration for 75% of target users within 4 weeks of Epic completion, reducing context setup time for web tools from 15+ minutes to under 30 seconds while maintaining full project context and organizational standards compliance.

### Target Users

Primary: Enterprise Development Leads (70%) - managing team AI standards and ensuring consistent agent usage across development workflows
Secondary: Software Architects (20%) - requiring project-specific context in architectural discussions and design validation
Tertiary: Individual Developers (10%) - seeking quick AI consultations with full project context during development tasks

## Scope

### What's Included

1. CLI bundle command with flexible scope options supporting all agents, specific agents, and single agent-task combinations (BR6)
2. Single-file bundle generation optimized for web chat tools with consolidated dependencies and system prompt formatting (BR7)
3. Web chat context limit compliance with intelligent truncation for GPT-4 (1M tokens) and Gemini Pro (2M tokens) (NFR5)
4. Bundle customization options including dependency depth control and output format preferences (BR8)

### What's Not Included

1. Advanced bundle analytics and usage tracking (deferred to future epic)
2. Custom bundle templates beyond default web chat optimization (out of MVP scope)
3. Real-time bundle synchronization with project changes (future enhancement)
4. Bundle sharing and distribution platform (organizational repository system - future roadmap)
5. Legacy web chat platform support beyond ChatGPT, Gemini Pro, Claude Web

### Dependencies

Epic Dependencies:

- Epic 1: KubeRocketAI Baseline (foundation agent definitions and project structure)
- Epic 2: Core Engine (agent validation and processing capabilities for bundle integrity)

System Dependencies:

- Golang runtime environment with memory management for large bundle processing
- File system access for reading agent definitions and writing bundle outputs
- CLI framework supporting complex command options and parameter validation

External Dependencies:

- Web chat platform API documentation for context limit specifications

## Solution Approach

Implementation Strategy:

1. Modular bundle builder with configurable scope resolution and dependency tracking
2. Template-driven output generation supporting multiple web chat platform formats

Technical Approach:

- CLI: Click-based command framework with rich parameter validation and help system
- Bundle Engine: Golang dependency resolver with graph-based agent relationship mapping

## Acceptance Criteria

1. Users can create comprehensive bundles using `krci-ai bundle --all` including all agents and dependencies within 10 seconds
   - Validation: Bundle generation completes for typical project with 20+ agents and 100+ dependencies
   - Command: `time krci-ai bundle --all && ls -la ./.krci/bundle/all.md`

2. Users can create targeted bundles using `krci-ai bundle --agents pm,architect` with specific agent selection and dependency resolution
   - Validation: Bundle contains only specified agents and their required dependencies
   - Command: `krci-ai bundle --agents pm,architect && grep -c "agent:" ./.krci/bundle/pm-architect.md`

3. Users can create focused bundles using `krci-ai bundle --agent pm --task create-prd` for single use cases
   - Validation: Bundle contains single agent with single task and minimal dependencies
   - Command: `krci-ai bundle --agent pm --task create-prd && wc -w ./.krci/bundle/pm-custom.md`

## User Stories

Planned Stories for Implementation:

### Phase 1: Core Bundle Framework (Sprint 4 Week 1)

- Story 5.01: Complete Bundle Generation with CLI
  - As an Enterprise Development Lead, I want to create complete agent bundles using CLI commands
  - Acceptance: `krci-ai bundle --all` command generates comprehensive bundle with all project context
  - Dependencies: Epic 1 baseline infrastructure and Epic 2 validation engine

- Story 5.02: Targeted Agent Bundle Selection
  - As an Enterprise Development Lead, I want to bundle specific agents for focused web chat interactions
  - Acceptance: `--agents` option creates bundles with selected agents and their dependencies
  - Dependencies: Story 5.01 completion and dependency resolution framework

- Story 5.03: Single Agent-Task Bundle Creation
  - As an Individual Developer, I want to create minimal bundles for specific tasks
  - Acceptance: `--agent --task` options create focused bundles for single use cases
  - Dependencies: Story 5.02 completion
