## Overview

### Problem Statement

The KubeRocketAI framework has accumulated technical debt from rapid MVP delivery that impacts development velocity and system maintainability.

### Goal

Consolidate all technical debt, enhancements, improvements, and refactoring across existing KubeRocketAI features to improve framework quality and development efficiency.

## Scope

### What's Included

1. Technical debt consolidation and code refactoring
2. Performance optimizations and improvements
3. Code quality enhancements and testing improvements
4. Documentation updates and maintenance
5. Security hardening and vulnerability fixes
6. Any other improvements to existing features

### What's Not Included

1. New feature development beyond technical improvements (deferred to future feature epics)
2. Major architectural redesigns requiring breaking changes (future roadmap consideration)
3. Third-party service integrations beyond existing scope (handled in integration epics)
4. User interface redesigns or UX changes (handled in UX improvement epics)
5. Platform expansion beyond current supported environments (deferred to expansion epics)

### Dependencies

- All previous epics (1-10) completed
- Existing framework infrastructure

## Acceptance Criteria

1. **Technical improvements completed**
   - Scenario: Framework components reviewed and enhanced
   - Expected Behavior: Improved code quality, performance, and maintainability
   - Measurement/Method: Code review and testing validation
   - Guardrails: No breaking changes to existing functionality

2. **Enhancement consolidation**
   - Scenario: All planned improvements and enhancements implemented
   - Expected Behavior: Framework operates with improved efficiency and reliability
   - Measurement/Method: Functional testing and performance validation
   - Guardrails: Backward compatibility maintained

## User Stories

### Story 99.01: Refactor Task Dependency Tracking System

- **As a** Framework Developer, **I want** a standardized metadata section at the top of each task file defining dependencies, **so that** I can clearly track and manage dependencies for templates, data sources, and MCP servers without relying on existing fragmented dependency agreement approaches
- **Status**: Draft
- **Priority**: High
- **Estimated Story Points**: 8
- **Dependencies**: None

Additional stories will be created as needed to address specific improvements, enhancements, and technical debt items within this epic scope.
