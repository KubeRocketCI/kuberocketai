## Overview

### Problem Statement

Development teams struggle with fragmented AI agent setup across different IDEs, requiring manual configuration for each development environment. Context switching between IDE environments and external AI platforms disrupts development flow, while inconsistent agent behavior across IDEs creates team productivity issues. Teams need automated IDE configuration generation that eliminates manual setup overhead and ensures consistent agent performance across Cursor, Claude Code, Windsurf, and VSCode platforms.

### Goal

Enable automated IDE integration for 90% of development teams within 5 minutes of setup, supporting Cursor, Claude Code, Windsurf, and VSCode with consistent agent performance under 5 seconds across all platforms while eliminating manual configuration overhead.

### Target Users

**Primary User**: Emily - Enterprise Development Lead requiring consistent AI agent integration across multiple IDEs used by her 8-15 developers.

**User Context**: 500+ Active Development Leads globally managing teams using diverse IDE environments (Cursor, Claude Code, Windsurf, VSCode) who need standardized agent integration without manual configuration overhead.

## Scope

### What's Included

**PRD Requirements Addressed:**

- **BR5 [P1]**: User can access advanced IDE integration guides with configuration examples for multiple development scenarios

**Core Deliverables:**

- `krci-ai install --ide=cursor` automated IDE-specific configuration generation
- `krci-ai install --all` for comprehensive IDE setup across all supported platforms
- IDE optimization for Cursor (@agent), Claude Code (/agent), Windsurf (@agent), VSCode (GitHub Copilot)
- Configuration validation and testing capabilities for generated setups
- Template library for common development scenarios
- Cross-IDE compatibility and standardization

### What's Not Included

- Custom IDE plugin development (uses standard filesystem access)
- IDE-specific UI components beyond configuration files
- Real-time IDE monitoring or analytics
- IDE version management or updates (focuses on configuration only)

### Dependencies

Epic Dependencies:

- Epic 3 Complete: Install command and asset management infrastructure
- Epic 2 Complete: Framework assets and validation system
- Epic 1 Complete: Agent definitions and schemas

System Dependencies:

- CLI command structure and configuration management capabilities
- Filesystem access for IDE configuration generation
- Cross-platform file path handling

External Dependencies:

- IDE-specific filesystem access permissions
- Standard IDE configuration directory structures

## Solution Approach

This epic implements automated IDE configuration generation through filesystem-based integration, maintaining the local-first architectural approach without requiring proprietary APIs or plugins. The solution uses template-based configuration generation optimized for each IDE's specific capabilities and integration patterns. Performance optimization ensures agent response times within 5 seconds across all supported IDEs while providing comprehensive validation tools for configuration correctness.

## Acceptance Criteria

1. Install command generates working IDE configurations for all supported platforms
   - Validation: Configuration files created in correct IDE-specific locations
   - Command: `krci-ai install --ide=all && find . -name "*.mdc" -o -name "*.chatmode.md"`

2. CLI commands complete within 5 seconds maintaining MVP performance standard
   - Validation: Command execution timing across all IDE installation operations
   - Command: `time krci-ai install --ide=cursor && time krci-ai validate --ide=cursor`

## Epic Summary

**Status**: Complete - Automated IDE integration achieved for Cursor, Claude Code, Windsurf, and GitHub Copilot with <2 second performance and 89/89 validation success across all integrations.

## User Stories

**Phase 1: Core IDE Integration**

- Story 04.01: Automated IDE configuration generation
  - As Emily, I want automated IDE configuration generation so that my team can use consistent AI agents across multiple IDEs
  - Acceptance: Configuration works in Cursor, Claude Code, Windsurf, and GitHub Copilot
  - Dependencies: Epic 3 completion

- Story 04.02: Single command installation
  - As a developer, I want to install IDE-specific configurations with a single command
  - Acceptance: `krci-ai install --ide=[target]` generates working configurations
  - Dependencies: Story 04.01 completion

**Phase 2: Enhanced Integration**

- Story 04.03: Windsurf IDE integration
  - As Emily, I want Windsurf IDE integration for comprehensive IDE coverage
  - Acceptance: Windsurf integration matches other IDE functionality
  - Dependencies: Story 04.02 completion

- Story 04.04: GitHub Copilot Chat integration
  - As a developer using GitHub Copilot, I want seamless KubeRocketAI agent integration
  - Acceptance: Agents work through GitHub Copilot Chat interface
  - Dependencies: Story 04.03 completion

## Epic Outcomes

**Delivered**: Comprehensive IDE integration across 4 major platforms with automated configuration generation, <2 second performance, and 89/89 validation success. Local-first approach maintained with filesystem-based integration requiring no proprietary APIs.
