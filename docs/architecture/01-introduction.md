# 1. Introduction

## 1.1 Project Overview

This document outlines the overall project architecture for KubeRocketAI, a declarative agentic framework designed to structure and optimize AI-assisted software development. The primary goal of this architecture is to serve as the guiding blueprint for the creation of the krci-ai CLI tool and the "Agent Playbook," ensuring consistency and adherence to the chosen patterns and technologies. It addresses the functional and non-functional requirements detailed in the KubeRocketAI PRD, providing a clear plan for implementation, deployment, and testing.

## 1.2 Problem Statement

Modern software development teams attempting to leverage Large Language Models (LLMs) face critical challenges that hinder productivity and scalability:

- **High Cognitive Overhead**: Current agentic solutions force developers to constantly switch context between IDEs and separate web platforms, creating significant friction and breaking development flow
- **DevOps Disconnect**: AI-generated code often fails CI/CD checks because agents lack awareness of project-specific rules, testing requirements, and deployment validation steps
- **Agent Management Complexity**: Teams lack a strategy for managing AI agents at scale, with no elegant way to maintain shared, reusable agents while allowing project-specific customization
- **Cross-Service Context Blindness**: In microservice architectures, AI agents operate in silos, unable to understand dependencies and potential impact across services
- **Workflow Rigidity**: Current tools impose rigid workflows and platform lock-in, preventing development of portable, version-controlled "AI-as-Code" methodologies
- **Scalability Failures**: AI assistants struggle with complex, long-running projects, leading to hallucinations and unproductive "AI chaos"

## 1.3 Solution Approach

KubeRocketAI addresses these challenges through an **AI-as-Code approach** that prioritizes **portability, maintainability, and simplicity**. The framework delivers AI agents to any source code without platform dependencies, using adapters for tooling alignment and storing prompts in git for sharing across codebases.

### Core Solution Components

**Declarative Agent Framework**: AI agents are defined in project-local Markdown files with YAML frontmatter, treating agent definitions as version-controlled "AI-as-Code" that can be managed with the same rigor as application code.

**IDE-Native Workflow**: The framework eliminates context-switching by operating directly within developers' existing IDEs and terminals, using local `.md` files that integrate seamlessly with AI-powered IDEs like Cursor, Claude Code, and Windsurf.

**Hybrid Agent Management**: For MVP deployment, supports embedded "golden library" agents extracted from the CLI binary for organizational consistency, combined with project-specific agents for specialized needs. This provides the perfect balance between shared standards and local flexibility while ensuring complete offline operation.

**Context-Aware Agent Distribution**: Like CI/CD pipelines (e.g., `.gitlab-ci.yaml`), agents can exist in both embedded golden libraries and specific codebases. Embedded agents provide common organizational context and standards, while repository-specific agents define local logic and rules. This hybrid approach enables agents to leverage shared knowledge while adapting to specific project requirements, CI/CD configurations, and development practices. Post-MVP versions will support remote repository sourcing while maintaining backward compatibility with the embedded approach.

## 1.4 Key Architectural Principles

### AI-as-Code Design

All agent definitions, prompts, and configurations are stored as human-readable text files in git repositories, enabling version control, collaboration, and transparent change management.

### Platform Independence

The framework avoids vendor lock-in by using standard file formats and protocols, ensuring agents can be used across different IDEs, CI/CD systems, and development environments.

### Progressive Complexity

The architecture supports a natural evolution from simple conversational agents to enterprise-scale systems without requiring refactoring, enabling teams to start simple and scale systematically.

### Transparency and Auditability

All AI interactions are based on explicit, version-controlled instructions, eliminating "black box" behaviors and enabling teams to understand and modify agent behavior.

### Minimal Cognitive Load

The framework integrates into existing developer workflows rather than requiring new tools or platforms, reducing friction and maintaining development flow.

## 1.5 Target Audiences

### Primary: Enterprise Development Teams

**Profile**: Teams of 5-50 developers working within established DevOps cultures, heavily reliant on CI/CD pipelines for code quality and deployment velocity.

**Needs**: Ensure AI-generated code adheres to internal standards, passes pipeline checks, and doesn't introduce architectural drift. Require transparent, customizable, and secure solutions with organizational-level agent management.

### Secondary: Individual Power Developers & Small Teams

**Profile**: Highly technical developers or small agile teams working on sophisticated projects, early adopters who are opinionated about their tools.

**Needs**: Lightweight, powerful, unopinionated framework providing full control to build custom agentic workflows without platform limitations.

### Tertiary: DevOps and Platform Engineers

**Profile**: Engineers responsible for CI/CD systems, infrastructure, and developer experience tooling.

**Needs**: Integration points for existing pipeline tools, monitoring capabilities, and governance mechanisms for AI-driven development processes.
