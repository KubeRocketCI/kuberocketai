This section defines the distribution and release management approach for KubeRocketAI, focusing on delivering both the CLI tool and AI framework assets as a cohesive system. The approach uses embedded asset distribution to simplify installation and ensure version consistency, while supporting progressive complexity and enterprise adoption patterns. By treating AI configurations with the same rigor as application code—version-controlled, auditable, and systematically distributed—this distribution strategy addresses the operational challenges of AI-as-Code deployment.

## 6.1 AI-as-Code Distribution Architecture

KubeRocketAI's distribution strategy treats the CLI tool and framework assets as a unified system to simplify deployment and ensure consistency. The monolithic CLI embeds framework assets (agents, tasks, templates, data) directly in the binary using Go's embed functionality, creating a self-contained distribution that eliminates external dependencies. While this approach has limitations in terms of flexibility and binary size, it provides significant advantages for MVP deployment: simplified installation, guaranteed asset availability, and elimination of version mismatch issues between CLI and framework components.

### 6.1.1 Unified Versioning Strategy

The CLI tool and framework assets share a single version number, released together through GoReleaser to maintain consistency and simplify user experience. This unified approach prevents version mismatches between the CLI and framework components while enabling atomic updates that either succeed completely or fail safely. Post-MVP evolution will separate these concerns, but MVP benefits from this simplified approach that mirrors the monolithic architecture.

### 6.1.2 Embedded Asset Architecture

Framework assets are compiled directly into the CLI binary using Go's embed functionality, creating a self-contained distribution that requires no external dependencies. This approach provides practical benefits for MVP deployment: users receive a complete system in a single download, installation complexity is minimized, and asset availability is guaranteed across all platforms. The embedded approach also enables build-time validation of all framework components, preventing runtime errors and ensuring quality. However, this approach increases binary size and limits runtime flexibility compared to external asset distribution models.

### 6.1.3 Progressive Complexity Support

The distribution architecture supports Level 1-4 installation complexity from a single binary, filtering embedded assets based on user sophistication and organizational needs. Users can start with basic conversational agents and progressively unlock structured workflows, formatted outputs, and knowledge-driven capabilities without requiring separate downloads or installations. This approach aligns with the progressive complexity principle while maintaining distribution simplicity.

### 6.1.4 Enterprise Foundation

Even in MVP, the distribution architecture includes enterprise-ready features like audit trails, compliance reporting, and security-first practices. Organizations need to track AI-as-Code adoption, maintain compliance with AI governance policies, and ensure secure distribution of AI capabilities. These foundational elements prepare for enterprise adoption while adding minimal complexity to the MVP experience.

## 6.2 Build Infrastructure

The build infrastructure transforms source code and framework assets into distributable binaries that work consistently across platforms and architectures. GoReleaser was chosen as the build automation tool because it provides native Go cross-compilation, automated release management, and seamless integration with GitHub Actions—essential capabilities for distributing AI-as-Code systems that must work reliably across diverse development environments. The build process validates framework assets at compile time, ensuring that every release contains a complete, verified AI-as-Code system.

### 6.2.1 Asset Embedding Process

Framework assets are embedded into the CLI binary during compilation using Go's embed functionality, creating a self-contained distribution that eliminates runtime dependencies. This approach ensures that users receive a complete AI-as-Code system in a single download, with all agents, tasks, templates, and data available immediately upon installation. The embedded assets undergo validation during the build process, preventing invalid framework components from reaching users.

### 6.2.2 Build-Time Validation

All framework assets are validated during the build process to ensure schema compliance, reference integrity, and dependency graph consistency before release. This architectural choice prevents runtime errors and ensures that every distributed binary contains a fully functional AI-as-Code system. Build-time validation acts as a quality gate, blocking releases that contain broken or incomplete framework components.

**Multi-Platform Build Strategy:**

| Platform | Architecture | Go Build Target | Package Format |
|----------|-------------|-----------------|----------------|
| Linux | amd64, arm64 | linux/amd64, linux/arm64 | Binary, Snap |
| macOS | amd64, arm64 | darwin/amd64, darwin/arm64 | Binary, Homebrew |
| Windows | amd64 | windows/amd64 | Binary, Chocolatey |

**CI/CD Pipeline Components:**

- **Source Control**: GitHub repository with branch protection
- **Build Automation**: GoReleaser for cross-platform compilation
- **Quality Assurance**: Automated validation and testing
- **Security Scanning**: Static analysis, dependency scanning, vulnerability checks
- **Code Signing**: Platform-specific binary signing for authenticity
- **Artifact Management**: GitHub Releases for distribution

**Build Process:**

```yaml
# GoReleaser configuration example
builds:
  - env: [CGO_ENABLED=0]
    goos: [linux, windows, darwin]
    goarch: [amd64, arm64]
    binary: krci-ai
    ldflags: -s -w -X main.version={{.Version}}
```

## 6.3 Distribution Channels

The distribution strategy combines multiple channels to serve different user adoption patterns, from individual developers discovering AI-as-Code to enterprise teams deploying at scale. Primary distribution through GitHub Releases provides universal access and transparency, while package manager integration (Homebrew, Chocolatey) delivers native installation experiences that developers expect. This multi-channel approach ensures that users can adopt KubeRocketAI through their preferred installation method while maintaining consistent access to the embedded AI framework assets.

### 6.3.1 Enterprise Distribution Patterns

Organizations require different distribution approaches than individual developers, often involving internal package repositories, security scanning, and controlled rollouts. The distribution architecture supports these enterprise patterns through signed binaries, comprehensive checksums, and deployment flexibility that works within corporate security policies. Enterprise teams can validate, approve, and distribute KubeRocketAI through their existing software management infrastructure while maintaining the unified AI-as-Code experience.

### 6.3.2 Primary Distribution: GitHub Releases

### 6.3.3 Package Manager Integration

#### 6.3.3 macOS and Linux: Homebrew

Homebrew distribution follows the "tap" repository pattern, where GoReleaser automatically manages a separate GitHub repository containing the homebrew formulas for package installation. This architectural approach separates the package metadata from the main project repository while enabling native macOS package manager integration. The tap repository serves as a dedicated distribution channel that homebrew clients can discover and install from, providing users with a familiar `brew install` experience.

**Homebrew Tap Repository Architecture:**

The `homebrew-tap` repository pattern involves creating a dedicated GitHub repository that follows the naming convention `tap`. GoReleaser automatically generates and maintains Ruby formula files in this repository's `Formula/` directory, updating them with each release to point to the latest GitHub release artifacts. This separation of concerns enables clean package distribution while maintaining automated formula updates through the CI/CD pipeline.

**Repository Structure:**

```bash
# Homebrew Tap Repository: kuberocketci/tap
├── Formula/
│   └── krci-ai.rb           # Generated by GoReleaser
├── README.md                # Tap documentation
└── .github/                 # GitHub Actions (optional)
```

**Installation User Experience:**

```bash
# One-time tap addition
brew tap kuberocketci/tap

# Install the CLI tool
brew install krci-ai

# Future updates
brew upgrade krci-ai
```

**GoReleaser Integration:**

## 6.4 Installation Experience

The installation experience is designed to support users across different sophistication levels, from developers trying AI-as-Code for the first time to enterprise teams deploying framework-wide. The progressive installation approach allows users to start with basic conversational agents and gradually unlock more sophisticated capabilities as their needs evolve. This architectural choice reduces initial complexity while providing a clear growth path that aligns with the Level 1-4 progressive complexity model.

### 6.4.1 Progressive Complexity Installation

Users can install different levels of framework complexity based on their current needs and organizational readiness, all from the same binary distribution. This approach enables new users to start with simple conversational agents while experienced teams can immediately access sophisticated workflows, templates, and knowledge-driven capabilities. The progressive model supports natural adoption patterns where individuals experiment with basic features before expanding to team-wide AI-as-Code implementations.

### 6.4.2 Enterprise Onboarding

Organizations adopting AI-as-Code require different onboarding patterns than individual developers, often involving pilot programs, training rollouts, and governance integration. The installation architecture supports these enterprise patterns through comprehensive validation, audit trail generation, and integration with existing development infrastructure. Enterprise teams can deploy KubeRocketAI across teams while maintaining visibility into AI-as-Code adoption and ensuring compliance with organizational policies.

## 6.5 Release Management

The release management process ensures that CLI tool and framework assets are released as a unified system, maintaining consistency and reliability across all distribution channels. The unified versioning strategy treats the CLI and embedded assets as a single product, preventing version mismatches that could break AI-as-Code workflows. This approach simplifies user experience while ensuring that every release delivers a complete, tested AI-as-Code system that works reliably across all platforms.

### 6.5.1 Quality Assurance Integration

Every release undergoes comprehensive quality assurance including framework asset validation, schema compliance checking, and integration testing before distribution. This architectural choice ensures that users receive reliable AI-as-Code systems that work consistently across different development environments and use cases. The quality gates prevent broken or incomplete framework components from reaching users, maintaining the high reliability standards required for enterprise adoption.

### 6.5.2 Versioning Strategy

Semantic Versioning (SemVer):

KubeRocketAI follows Semantic Versioning 2.0.0 specification, a widely-adopted versioning scheme that uses three-part version numbers (MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH) to communicate the nature and impact of changes. This approach provides clear signals to users about compatibility, upgrade safety, and feature evolution.

Version Components:

- **MAJOR** (X.y.z): Breaking changes to CLI interface or framework structure that require user migration
- **MINOR** (x.Y.z): New features, new commands, backward-compatible changes that extend functionality
- **PATCH** (x.y.Z): Bug fixes, security updates, documentation improvements that maintain compatibility

Version Examples:

- `v1.0.0` - Initial stable release
- `v1.1.0` - New CLI commands or framework features
- `v1.1.1` - Bug fixes and patches
- `v2.0.0` - Breaking changes requiring user migration

Pre-release Versioning:

- `v1.0.0-alpha.1` - Early development versions
- `v1.0.0-beta.1` - Feature-complete pre-release
- `v1.0.0-rc.1` - Release candidate ready for production validation

### 6.5.3 Release Channels

| Channel | Purpose | Frequency | Stability |
|---------|---------|-----------|-----------|
| **Stable** | Production use | Monthly | High |
| **Beta** | Pre-release testing | Bi-weekly | Medium |
| **RC** | Release candidates | As needed | High |
| **Development** | Nightly builds | Daily | Low |

### 6.5.4 Release Automation

On-Demand Release Process:

Releases are triggered on-demand through GitHub Actions when a semantic version tag is pushed to the main branch. This approach provides controlled, predictable releases that maintain quality while enabling rapid delivery of critical fixes and features. The pipeline ensures all quality gates pass before creating and distributing the release.

GitHub Actions Pipeline:

```yaml
# Release triggered by semantic version tags (e.g., v1.0.0)
on:
  push:
    tags:
      - 'v*.*.*'
```

Release Pipeline Steps:

1. **Tag Validation**: Verify semantic version format and increment
2. **Checkout**: Retrieve source code at tagged commit
3. **Quality Gates**: Execute comprehensive validation checks
4. **Build**: Cross-platform binary compilation with GoReleaser
5. **Security**: Code signing and checksum generation
6. **Release**: GitHub release creation with artifacts
7. **Distribution**: Package manager updates and notifications

Quality Gates (Must Pass):

- ✅ **Quality Assurance**: Comprehensive validation and testing
- ✅ **Security Scans**: Vulnerability scanning, dependency checks, static analysis
- ✅ **Build Validation**: Multi-platform compilation success
- ✅ **Asset Validation**: Framework asset schema compliance and integrity
- ✅ **Documentation**: Changelog generation and documentation updates
- ✅ **Code Signing**: Binary signing verification

Pipeline Configuration:

```yaml
# GitHub Actions workflow example
name: Release
jobs:
  release:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4
      - name: Run Quality Gates
        run: |
          make quality-checks
          make security-scan
          make validate-assets
      - name: Release with GoReleaser
        uses: goreleaser/goreleaser-action@v5
        with:
          version: latest
          args: release --clean
        env:
          GITHUB_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
```

Release Failure Handling:

- Failed quality gates block release creation
- Detailed failure reports sent to release managers
- Rollback procedures for corrupted releases
- Emergency hotfix process for critical issues

### 6.5.5 Update Mechanisms

**MVP Bundle-Based Updates:**

The MVP uses bundle-based updates where CLI and framework assets are versioned together and distributed via package managers. This approach ensures consistency and simplifies the update process while maintaining offline operation for core functionality.

```bash
# Check for available CLI updates (online)
krci-ai check-updates    # Check GitHub releases for newer versions

# Update CLI via package manager (includes new embedded assets)
brew upgrade krci-ai     # macOS/Linux
choco upgrade krci-ai    # Windows

# Extract updated framework assets after CLI upgrade
krci-ai update          # Guided process for framework asset update
```

**Package Manager Updates (Recommended):**

- **Homebrew**: `brew upgrade krci-ai` (macOS/Linux)
- **Chocolatey**: `choco upgrade krci-ai` (Windows)
- **Manual**: Download latest from GitHub Releases

**Migration Support:**

- Backward compatibility guarantees for minor versions
- Migration guides for major version upgrades
- Framework component compatibility validation between CLI and local assets
- Automatic configuration migration when possible

**Post-MVP Evolution:**

Future versions will support direct framework asset updates from remote repositories while maintaining backward compatibility with the bundle-based approach. This will enable community contributions, domain-specific frameworks, and organizational customizations.

## 6.6 Distribution Security

The security architecture protects both CLI tool integrity and framework asset authenticity throughout the distribution process, ensuring that users receive verified AI-as-Code systems free from tampering or corruption. Security measures include platform-specific code signing, comprehensive checksum verification, and supply chain security practices that meet enterprise standards. This security-first approach builds trust with enterprise customers while protecting individual developers from potential security risks.

### 6.6.1 Framework Asset Security

Embedded framework assets undergo the same security validation as the CLI tool itself, ensuring that AI agents, tasks, templates, and data maintain integrity throughout the distribution process. This architectural choice prevents malicious or corrupted framework components from reaching users while maintaining the performance benefits of embedded distribution. The security model treats framework assets as code, applying the same security rigor to AI configurations as to application logic.

### 6.6.2 Enterprise Security Compliance

Organizations require distribution security that meets their governance and compliance requirements, often involving additional validation, audit trails, and integration with existing security infrastructure.

### 6.6.3 Code Signing and Verification

GoReleaser Signing Capabilities:

KubeRocketAI leverages GoReleaser's built-in signing capabilities to provide artifact authentication without requiring platform-specific certificates. The signing strategy focuses on checksum file signing and supports both traditional GPG and modern keyless signing approaches.

Primary Signing Methods:

- **Checksum Signing**: Sign the checksums.txt file containing all artifact hashes
- **GPG Signing**: Traditional GPG signatures for broad compatibility
- **Cosign Integration**: Keyless signing using Sigstore for modern security

GoReleaser Signing Configuration:

```yaml
# .goreleaser.yaml signing configuration
signs:
  - artifacts: checksum
    cmd: gpg
    args: ["--output", "${signature}", "--detach-sign", "${artifact}"]

checksum:
  name_template: "checksums.txt"
  algorithm: sha256
```

Cosign Keyless Signing (Alternative):

```yaml
# Modern keyless signing with cosign
signs:
  - cmd: cosign
    stdin: '{{ .Env.COSIGN_PWD }}'
    args:
      - "sign-blob"
      - "--key=cosign.key"
      - "--output-signature=${signature}"
      - "${artifact}"
      - "--yes"
    artifacts: checksum
```

Verification Process:

```bash
# Download artifacts and signatures
wget https://github.com/org/krci-ai/releases/download/v1.0.0/checksums.txt
wget https://github.com/org/krci-ai/releases/download/v1.0.0/checksums.txt.sig

# Verify signature (GPG)
gpg --verify checksums.txt.sig checksums.txt

# Verify artifact integrity
sha256sum --ignore-missing -c checksums.txt

# Verify with cosign (if using keyless signing)
cosign verify-blob --key cosign.pub --signature checksums.txt.sig checksums.txt
```

Security Benefits:

- **Integrity**: SHA256 checksums ensure artifact integrity
- **Authenticity**: GPG/cosign signatures verify publisher identity
- **Transparency**: Public key verification enables third-party validation
- **Automation**: Fully automated through GitHub Actions pipeline
