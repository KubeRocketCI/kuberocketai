# 9. Coding Standards

This document establishes the coding standards, conventions, and quality principles for KubeRocketAI development to ensure consistency, maintainability, and high-quality code across the project.

## 9.1 Philosophy and Approach

### 9.1.1 Core Principles

**AI-as-Code First**: All code should support the AI-as-Code philosophy, treating AI configurations as version-controlled assets with the same rigor as application code.

**Simplicity Over Complexity**: Favor straightforward, readable solutions over complex optimizations unless performance is critical.

**Consistency Over Perfection**: Maintain consistent patterns across the codebase to reduce cognitive load for contributors.

**Self-Documenting Code**: Write code that explains itself through clear naming, structure, and minimal but meaningful comments.

### 9.1.2 Quality Standards

**Reliability**: All code must handle errors gracefully and provide meaningful feedback to users.

**Testability**: Code should be designed to be easily testable with clear input/output boundaries.

**Maintainability**: Prioritize code that can be easily understood and modified by team members.

**Portability**: Ensure cross-platform compatibility across macOS, Linux, and Windows.

## 9.2 Go Development Standards

### 9.2.1 Code Organization

**Package Structure**: Follow the established internal package structure with clear separation of concerns between CLI, engine, assets, validation, integration, and utilities.

**Dependency Management**: Use Go modules for dependency management, prefer standard library over external dependencies when possible.

**Interface Design**: Design interfaces that are minimal, focused, and stable to support testing and future evolution.

### 9.2.2 Error Handling

**Explicit Error Handling**: All errors must be explicitly handled, never ignored.

**User-Friendly Messages**: Error messages should be actionable and helpful to end users.

**Graceful Degradation**: When possible, provide fallback behavior rather than complete failure.

### 9.2.3 CLI Development

**Command Structure**: Follow established CLI patterns with clear command hierarchies and consistent flag usage.

**User Experience**: Prioritize colorized output, progress indicators, and interactive prompts where appropriate.

**Non-Interactive Mode**: All commands must support non-interactive execution for CI/CD integration.

## 9.3 Framework Asset Standards

### 9.3.1 Asset Validation

**Schema Compliance**: All framework assets must validate against their defined schemas.

**Reference Integrity**: Asset references must be validated to prevent broken links.

**Version Compatibility**: Assets must be compatible with their target CLI version.

### 9.3.2 Asset Organization

**Clear Naming**: Use descriptive names that clearly indicate asset purpose and scope.

**Proper Categorization**: Follow the established framework structure (agents, tasks, templates, data).

**Documentation**: All assets should include clear descriptions and usage examples.

## 9.4 Quality Assurance

### 9.4.1 Code Review

**Peer Review**: All code changes require review by at least one other team member.

**Architecture Review**: Changes affecting core architecture require architect approval.

**Documentation Review**: Documentation changes should be reviewed for clarity and accuracy.

### 9.4.2 Automated Quality Checks

**Linting**: Use established Go linting tools to enforce coding standards.

**Formatting**: Use gofmt and other standard Go formatting tools.

**Security Scanning**: Include security scanning in the development pipeline.

## 9.5 Development Workflow

### 9.5.1 Version Control

**Git Flow**: Use feature branches with pull requests for all changes.

**Commit Messages**: Write clear, descriptive commit messages that explain the change.

**Change Documentation**: Document breaking changes and new features.

### 9.5.2 Continuous Integration

**Build Verification**: All changes must build successfully on target platforms.

**Test Execution**: All tests must pass before merging changes.

**Asset Validation**: Framework assets must validate before release.

## 9.6 Documentation Standards

### 9.6.1 Code Documentation

**Public APIs**: All public functions and types must have clear documentation.

**Complex Logic**: Document complex algorithms or business logic.

**Examples**: Provide usage examples for public interfaces.

### 9.6.2 Project Documentation

**Architecture Changes**: Document significant architectural decisions and their rationale.

**User Guides**: Maintain clear, up-to-date user documentation.

**Developer Guides**: Provide guidance for new contributors.

## 9.7 Performance and Security

### 9.7.1 Performance Considerations

**Reasonable Performance**: Optimize for user experience, not micro-optimizations.

**Resource Usage**: Be mindful of memory and CPU usage, especially for large projects.

**Scalability**: Design for the expected scale of framework usage.

### 9.7.2 Security Practices

**Input Validation**: Validate all user inputs and external data.

**File Operations**: Use secure file operations and respect permissions.

**Dependency Security**: Regularly audit and update dependencies.

## 9.8 Implementation Guidelines

### 9.8.1 Development Environment

**Tooling**: Use established development tools and IDE configurations.

**Local Testing**: Test changes locally before submitting for review.

**Environment Consistency**: Maintain consistent development environments across team members.

### 9.8.2 Release Standards

**Version Numbering**: Follow semantic versioning for releases.

**Release Notes**: Provide clear release notes for all changes.

**Backward Compatibility**: Maintain compatibility where possible, document breaking changes clearly.

## 9.9 Team Collaboration

### 9.9.1 Communication

**Technical Discussions**: Use established channels for technical discussions and decisions.

**Documentation Updates**: Keep documentation current with code changes.

**Knowledge Sharing**: Share knowledge and best practices within the team.

### 9.9.2 Learning and Growth

**Best Practices**: Continuously improve development practices based on experience.

**Code Reviews**: Use code reviews as learning opportunities.

**External Standards**: Stay current with Go community best practices and standards.
