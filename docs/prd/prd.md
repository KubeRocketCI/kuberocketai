# KubeRocketAI Product Requirements Document

## 1. Problem/Opportunity

**Core Problem**: While development teams have successfully adopted "Infrastructure-as-Code" and declarative CI/CD pipeline management, AI agent configuration remains ad-hoc and fragmented. Teams face critical inefficiencies due to inconsistent agent management, lack of version control integration, and inability to apply proven DevOps patterns to AI workflow governance.

**Specific Pain Points**:

- Developers experience high cognitive overhead switching between AI tools and native IDE environments
- AI-generated code frequently doesn't align with project-specific rules, dependencies, patterns, and architectural standards because agents lack codebase context
- Teams struggle with inconsistent AI agent configurations across projects with no organizational standards
- Current AI tools operate as "black boxes" without transparency, auditability, or version control integration

**Evidence**:

Based on interviews with 5 developer teams, community forum analysis, and market research:

**User Research Findings:**

- Developers spend 5-10 minutes daily (25-50 minutes weekly) adjusting AI-generated code for project standards
- 3 out of 5 teams have inconsistent AI agent setups across repositories, leading to 15% code review delays
- Context switching between IDE and AI platforms occurs 2-3 times daily, disrupting developer flow
- Security teams report 40% of organizations lack AI change tracking and auditability measures

**Market Validation:**

- Current GitHub stars: 4 (baseline for growth measurement)
- Target market: 10+ Active Development Leads expanding to strategic adoption within established DevOps organizations
- Existing solutions are primarily heavy SaaS platforms with 3-6 month adoption timelines
- Gap exists for lightweight, version-controlled approach that developers expect from modern DevOps tools

**Business Impact:**

- Estimated productivity loss: 8-12 hours per developer per month on manual AI code adjustments
- Cost of inconsistent standards: 15-20% increase in code review cycles

## 2. Target Users & Use Cases

**Primary User**: Emily - Enterprise Development Lead

*Demographics*: Senior Developer/Tech Lead managing 8-15 developers across 3-4 microservices in Fortune 500 company with established DevOps culture. 7+ years development experience, 2+ years with AI tools.

*User Volume*: 10+ Active Development Leads (expanding from current early adopter base to strategic adoption)
*Usage Patterns*: Manages 3-5 active repositories, reviews 1-2 PRs weekly, evaluates new development tools quarterly
*Demographics*: Global enterprise adoption across continents, 80% use AI-enhanced IDEs (Cursor, Claude Code, WindSurf), team leads and senior developers

*Pain Points*: AI-generated code doesn't follow project standards and patterns, team lacks consistent agent configurations, security teams require auditability, context switching between IDE and external AI platforms disrupts flow.

**Key Use Cases**:

1. **Standardized Agent Management**: Define and share consistent AI agent configurations across team projects
2. **Standards Compliance**: Ensure AI-generated code adheres to project-specific patterns, architectural requirements, and organizational standards
3. **Context-Aware Development**: AI agents understand project-specific rules, dependencies, and standards
4. **Transparent Workflows**: Maintain auditability and transparency in AI-assisted development processes
5. **Web Chat Integration**: Bundle agents and dependencies into single-file packages for use with web-based AI tools (ChatGPT, Gemini Pro, Claude Web)

---

## 3. Current Journeys/Landscape *(Optional)*

**Current User Journey**: Developers manually configure AI tools per project, copy-paste prompts across team members, and frequently need to manually fix AI-generated code that doesn't align with project standards, patterns, and architectural requirements.

**Platform Integration**: KubeRocketAI enhances existing IDE capabilities (GitHub Copilot, Cursor, Claude Code, WindSurf) by providing a universal agent management framework. Rather than competing with these tools, we enable consistent agent definitions that work seamlessly across all platforms, adding team-scale governance and CI/CD integration that individual IDEs don't provide.

**Web Chat Expansion**: Beyond IDE integration, KubeRocketAI addresses the growing need for web-based AI tool integration. Developers frequently use ChatGPT, Gemini Pro, and Claude Web for quick consultations but lose project context. Our bundling capability creates single-file packages containing all relevant agents and dependencies, enabling seamless context transfer to web tools while maintaining organizational standards and project-specific knowledge.

## 4. Proposed Solution/Elevator Pitch

**Elevator Pitch**: KubeRocketAI brings the proven "Infrastructure-as-Code" and CI/CD pipeline model to AI agent management. Teams define agents in version-controlled Markdown files that can live alongside code or be imported from shared organizational libraries, enabling the same flexibility developers expect from modern CI/CD workflows while ensuring agent consistency, auditability, and seamless IDE integration.

**Top 4 MVP Value Props**:

1. **Project-Local Agent Definitions**: Version-controlled Markdown files eliminate external dependencies and enable team collaboration through standard git workflows
2. **Project Context Awareness**: Agents understand codebase-specific rules, dependencies, and patterns, significantly reducing manual fixes through deep project integration
3. **Universal Compatibility**: Works seamlessly across IDEs (Cursor, Claude Code, WindSurf) and web chat tools (ChatGPT, Gemini Pro) through flexible bundling without vendor lock-in
4. **Token Size Transparency**: Built-in token calculation and size estimation helps users understand asset composition and optimize for AI platform context limits, preventing runtime failures and enabling informed decision-making

**Conceptual Model**: Following the proven CI/CD pipeline pattern, KubeRocketAI enables agent definitions to live alongside code (project-specific) or be imported from shared organizational libraries, with dynamic composition at runtime. Just as teams use shared CI/CD templates while maintaining project-specific customizations, developers use `krci-ai install` to scaffold projects with organizational agent standards, then customize locally while preserving shared governance and best practices.
