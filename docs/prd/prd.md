# KubeRocketAI Product Requirements Document

## 1. Problem/Opportunity

**Core Problem**: While development teams have successfully adopted "Pipeline-as-Code" and declarative CI/CD pipeline management, AI agent configuration remains ad-hoc and fragmented. Teams face critical inefficiencies due to inconsistent agent management, lack of version control integration, and inability to apply proven DevOps patterns to AI workflow governance.

**Specific Pain Points**:

- Developers experience high cognitive overhead switching between AI tools and native IDE environments
- AI-generated code frequently doesn't align with project-specific rules, dependencies, patterns, and architectural standards because agents lack codebase context
- Teams struggle with inconsistent AI agent configurations across projects with no organizational standards
- Current AI tools operate as "black boxes" without transparency, auditability, or version control integration

**Evidence**:

Based on interviews with 5 developer teams, community forum analysis, and market research:

**User Research Findings:**

- Developers spend 5-10 minutes daily (25-50 minutes weekly) adjusting AI-generated code for project standards
- 3 out of 5 teams have inconsistent AI agent setups across repositories, leading to 15% code review delays
- Context switching between IDE and AI platforms occurs 2-3 times daily, disrupting developer flow
- Security teams report 40% of organizations lack AI change tracking and auditability measures

**Market Validation:**

- Current GitHub stars: 4 (baseline for growth measurement)
- Target market: 10+ Active Development Leads expanding to strategic adoption within established DevOps organizations
- Existing solutions are primarily heavy SaaS platforms with 3-6 month adoption timelines
- Gap exists for lightweight, version-controlled approach that developers expect from modern DevOps tools

**Business Impact:**

- Estimated productivity loss: 8-12 hours per developer per month on manual AI code adjustments
- Cost of inconsistent standards: 15-20% increase in code review cycles

## 2. Target Users & Use Cases

**Primary Users**: AI Adopters Across SDLC Roles

*Demographics*: Product Owners, Product Managers, Business Analysts, QA Engineers, Developers, Architects, and Team Leads who actively use AI tools in their daily workflows. Basic experience with AI-enhanced development tools, work primarily within IDEs (Cursor, GitHub Copilot, Claude Code, WindSurf, VS Code) as their main interface for development tasks.

*User Volume*: 50+ AI adopters across various SDLC roles (expanding from current developer-focused adoption to cross-functional team adoption)
*Usage Patterns*: Use IDEs daily for primary work, leverage AI tools 3-5 times per day, occasionally use web-based AI tools (ChatGPT, Claude Desktop, Gemini Pro) for specialized tasks, prefer staying within their IDE environment
*Demographics*: Cross-functional teams globally, 95% use AI-enhanced IDEs daily, span all SDLC roles from product strategy to quality assurance

*Pain Points*: AI-generated content doesn't follow role-specific patterns and organizational standards, lack consistent AI agent configurations across projects and roles, context switching between IDE and external AI platforms disrupts workflow, difficulty maintaining project context when using web-based AI tools.

**Key Use Cases**:

1. **Cross-Role Agent Standardization**: Product Owners, Developers, QA Engineers, and Business Analysts define and share consistent AI agent configurations across team projects through Git-versioned workflows
2. **Role-Specific Standards Compliance**: Ensure AI-generated content (code, requirements, test cases, documentation) adheres to role-specific patterns, organizational standards, and project requirements
3. **Context-Aware SDLC Support**: AI agents understand project-specific rules, dependencies, and standards relevant to each SDLC role and deliverable type
4. **Pipeline-Based Workflows**: Maintain auditability and transparency in AI-assisted processes through Git repository management, enabling agent workflows that can be connected into larger pipelines
5. **Flexible Deployment Options**: Bundle agents and dependencies for IDE-native use or single-file packages for web-based AI tools (ChatGPT, Claude Desktop, Gemini Pro) based on user preference and context needs

---

## 3. Current Journeys/Landscape *(Optional)*

**Current User Journey**: SDLC practitioners (developers, product owners, QA engineers, business analysts) manually configure AI tools per project, copy-paste prompts across team members, and frequently need to manually fix AI-generated content (code, requirements, test cases, documentation) that doesn't align with project standards, role-specific patterns, and organizational requirements.

**IDE-First Platform Integration**: KubeRocketAI enhances existing IDE capabilities (GitHub Copilot, Cursor, Claude Code, WindSurf) by providing a universal agent management framework that keeps users in their preferred development environment. Rather than competing with these tools, we enable consistent agent definitions that work seamlessly across all platforms, adding team-scale governance and CI/CD integration that individual IDEs don't provide. Users maintain their daily IDE workflow while gaining access to organizational agent standards and project-specific context.

**Flexible Bundling for Web Chat**: While maintaining IDE-first design, KubeRocketAI addresses the periodic need for web-based AI tool integration. When users need to leverage large context window models (supporting million+ tokens) in ChatGPT, Claude Desktop, Gemini Pro, or other web platforms for specialized consultations like brainstorming and elicitation—where web platforms offer better cost efficiency than IDE-based models—our bundling capability creates single-file system prompts containing all relevant agents and dependencies. This enables seamless context transfer to web tools while preserving organizational standards and project-specific knowledge.

## 4. Proposed Solution/Elevator Pitch

**Elevator Pitch**: KubeRocketAI brings the proven "Pipeline-as-Code" and CI/CD pipeline model to AI agent management. Teams define agents in version-controlled Markdown files that can live alongside code or be imported from shared organizational libraries, enabling the same flexibility developers expect from modern CI/CD workflows while ensuring agent consistency, auditability, and seamless IDE integration.

**Top 4 MVP Value Props**:

1. **Project-Local Agent Definitions**: Version-controlled Markdown files eliminate external dependencies and enable team collaboration through standard git workflows
2. **Project Context Awareness**: Agents understand codebase-specific rules, dependencies, and patterns, significantly reducing manual fixes through deep project integration
3. **IDE-First Universal Compatibility**: Prioritizes native IDE experience (Cursor, GitHub Copilot, Claude Code, WindSurf) while providing flexible bundling for web chat tools (ChatGPT, Claude Desktop, Gemini Pro) when needed, ensuring no vendor lock-in and supporting user's preferred workflow
4. **Token Size Transparency**: Built-in token calculation and size estimation helps users understand asset composition and optimize for AI platform context limits, preventing runtime failures and enabling informed decision-making

**Conceptual Model**: Following the proven CI/CD pipeline pattern, KubeRocketAI enables agent definitions to live alongside code (project-specific) or be imported from shared organizational libraries, with dynamic composition at runtime. Just as teams use shared CI/CD templates while maintaining project-specific customizations, SDLC practitioners use `krci-ai install` to scaffold projects with organizational agent standards, then customize locally while preserving shared governance and best practices. This Git-based approach allows agents to be connected into workflows, reflecting the true pipeline nature of connecting specialized AI agents for complex SDLC processes.
