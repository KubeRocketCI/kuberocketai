## Dependencies

- **Story 01.01 Reference**: Can follow agent creation patterns established in architect agent story

## Story

**As a** Software Developer,
**I want** a complete developer agent framework with implementation and coding assistance capabilities including agent definition, structured tasks, output templates, and reference data,
**so that** I can immediately use KubeRocketAI for comprehensive code generation, review, and debugging tasks with consistent outputs.

## Acceptance Criteria

1. `developer.yaml` agent is created with implementation and coding assistance capabilities
2. Agent includes code generation and review capabilities
3. Agent has debugging and refactoring assistance prompts
4. Agent works effectively in Cursor (@agent) and Claude Code (/agent)
5. Agent behavioral guidelines and reference patterns are defined
6. Agent follows established format with identity grouping for consistency
7. Core development tasks are created with procedural workflows
8. Tasks include `implement-feature`, `review-code`, `debug-issue`, `refactor-code` capabilities
9. Tasks reference templates and data assets using inline `[filename](path)` markdown links
10. Tasks follow established format for consistency
11. Output templates are created for consistent development documentation
12. Templates include `code-review.md`, `implementation-plan.md`, `debug-report.md`, `refactoring-guide.md`
13. Templates use variable placeholders (`{{variable_name}}`) for dynamic content
14. Templates follow established format for consistency
15. Reference data is created for development guidelines and standards
16. Data includes `coding-standards.md`, `best-practices.md`, `testing-strategy.md`
17. Data assets are organized by purpose (behavioral for agents, technical for tasks)
18. Data follows established format for consistency
19. All four asset types work together in the progressive complexity model
20. Basic IDE usage is tested and documented with all asset types

## Description

This story establishes the developer agent framework as the second complete implementation of the KubeRocketAI four-asset-type model. The developer agent provides comprehensive coding assistance capabilities including feature implementation, code review, debugging, and refactoring support. Following the pattern established in Story 01.01, this story demonstrates the progressive complexity model with all four asset types (agent, tasks, templates, data) working together to provide a complete development workflow framework.
