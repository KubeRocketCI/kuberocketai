## Dependencies

- **Story 1.1 Reference**: Can follow agent creation patterns established in architect agent story

## Story

**As a** Business Analyst,
**I want** a complete BA agent framework with business analysis and requirements gathering capabilities including agent definition, structured tasks, output templates, and reference data,
**so that** I can immediately use KubeRocketAI for comprehensive business analysis and requirements gathering with consistent outputs.

## Acceptance Criteria

1. `ba.yaml` agent is created with business analysis and requirements gathering capabilities
2. Agent includes requirements elicitation and process mapping capabilities
3. Agent has comprehensive business analysis and user journey analysis prompts
4. Agent works effectively in Cursor (@agent) and Claude Code (/agent)
5. Agent behavioral guidelines and reference patterns are defined
6. Agent follows established format with identity grouping for consistency
7. Core business analysis tasks are created with procedural workflows
8. Tasks include `gather-requirements`, `analyze-processes`, `map-user-journeys`, `document-business-rules` capabilities
9. Tasks reference templates and data assets using inline `[filename](path)` markdown links
10. Tasks follow established format for consistency
11. Output templates are created for consistent business analysis documentation
12. Templates include `requirements-doc.md`, `process-map.md`, `user-journey.md`, `business-rules.md`
13. Templates use variable placeholders (`{{variable_name}}`) for dynamic content
14. Templates follow established format for consistency
15. Reference data is created for business analysis methodologies and standards
16. Data includes `analysis-methodologies.md`, `business-frameworks.md`, `requirements-standards.md`
17. Data assets are organized by purpose (behavioral for agents, technical for tasks)
18. Data follows established format for consistency
19. All four asset types work together in the progressive complexity model
20. Basic IDE usage is tested and documented with all asset types
21. JSON Schema validation available for agent validation with identity grouping support
22. Professional validation tool available with automatic .venv setup
23. Comprehensive validation including schema compliance and framework rules
24. Cross-platform validation tooling with clear error reporting
25. Validation success confirms framework integrity and format compliance

## Description

This story establishes the business analyst agent framework as the fifth complete implementation of the KubeRocketAI four-asset-type model. The BA agent provides comprehensive business analysis capabilities including requirements gathering, process analysis, user journey mapping, and business rules documentation. Following the established pattern, this demonstrates the progressive complexity model with all four asset types (agent, tasks, templates, data) working together to provide a complete business analysis workflow framework.

  - [x] Create `assets/framework/core/templates/user-journey.md` with user journey format
  - [x] Create `assets/framework/core/templates/business-rules.md` with business rules documentation format
  - [x] Implement `{{variable_name}}` syntax for dynamic content
  - [x] Ensure templates follow established format from ([Source](docs/architecture/04-data-models.md))
- [x] Task 4: Create Data Assets (AC: 15, 16, 17, 18)
  - [x] Create `assets/framework/core/data/analysis-methodologies.md` for behavioral guidelines
