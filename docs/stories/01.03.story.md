## Dependencies

- **Story 01.01 Reference**: Can follow agent creation patterns established in architect agent story

## Story

**As a** Product Manager,
**I want** a complete PM agent framework with product management capabilities including agent definition, structured tasks, output templates, and reference data,
**so that** I can immediately use KubeRocketAI for comprehensive PRD creation, market analysis, feature prioritization, and stakeholder communication with consistent outputs.

## Acceptance Criteria

1. `pm.yaml` agent is created with product management and requirements capabilities
2. Agent includes PRD creation and market analysis capabilities
3. Agent has feature prioritization and stakeholder communication prompts
4. Agent works effectively in Cursor (@agent) and Claude Code (/agent)
5. Agent behavioral guidelines and reference patterns are defined
6. Agent follows established format with identity grouping for consistency
7. Core product management tasks are created with procedural workflows
8. Tasks include `create-prd`, `analyze-market`, `prioritize-features`, `stakeholder-communication` capabilities
9. Tasks reference templates and data assets using inline `[filename](path)` markdown links
10. Tasks follow established format for consistency
11. Output templates are created for consistent product management documentation
12. Templates include `prd-template.md`, `market-analysis.md`, `feature-prioritization.md`, `stakeholder-report.md`
13. Templates use variable placeholders (`{{variable_name}}`) for dynamic content
14. Templates follow established format for consistency
15. Reference data is created for product management guidelines and standards
16. Data includes `product-principles.md`, `market-data.md`, `prioritization-frameworks.md`
17. Data assets are organized by purpose (behavioral for agents, technical for tasks)
18. Data follows established format for consistency
19. All four asset types work together in the progressive complexity model
20. Basic IDE usage is tested and documented with all asset types
21. JSON Schema validation available for agent validation with identity grouping support
22. Professional validation tool available with automatic .venv setup
23. Comprehensive validation including schema compliance and framework rules
24. Cross-platform validation tooling with clear error reporting
25. Validation success confirms framework integrity and format compliance

## Description

This story establishes the product manager agent framework as the third complete implementation of the KubeRocketAI four-asset-type model. The PM agent provides comprehensive product management capabilities including PRD creation, market analysis, feature prioritization, and stakeholder communication. Following the pattern established in previous stories, this demonstrates the progressive complexity model with all four asset types (agent, tasks, templates, data) working together to provide a complete product management workflow framework.

## Tasks/Subtasks

- [x] Task 3: Create Template Assets (AC: 11, 12, 13, 14)
  - [x] Create `assets/framework/core/templates/prd-template.md` with PRD format
  - [x] Create `assets/framework/core/templates/market-analysis.md` with analysis format
  - [x] Create `assets/framework/core/templates/feature-prioritization.md` with prioritization format
  - [x] Create `assets/framework/core/templates/stakeholder-report.md` with communication format
  - [x] Implement `{{variable_name}}` syntax for dynamic content
  - [x] Ensure templates follow established format from ([Source](docs/architecture/04-data-models.md))
- [x] Task 4: Create Data Assets (AC: 15, 16, 17, 18)
  - [x] Create `assets/framework/core/data/product-principles.md` for behavioral guidelines
  - [x] Create `assets/framework/core/data/market-data.md` for technical constraints
