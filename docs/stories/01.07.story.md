## Dependencies

- **Stories 1.1-1.5 Complete**: Core Agent Definitions required for dogfooding usage
- **Story 1.6 Complete**: Basic CLI tool needed for dogfooding development workflow

## Story

**As a** KubeRocketAI Development Team,
**I want** to establish a dogfooding environment where we use our own agents and framework to develop KubeRocketAI itself,
**so that** we validate the framework's effectiveness through real-world usage and identify improvement opportunities early.

## Acceptance Criteria

1. Repository structure is established using our own framework patterns
2. CI/CD pipeline is operational using our own agents for development
3. Development team is using KubeRocketAI agents for daily development tasks
4. Self-dogfooding development workflow is documented and validated
5. Framework effectiveness is measured through internal usage metrics
6. Feedback loop is established for continuous framework improvement
7. Development process demonstrates the framework's value proposition
8. Complete framework adoption guide enables anyone to create agents, tasks, templates, and data using our architecture approach, even without CLI tooling

## Description

This story establishes a dogfooding environment where the KubeRocketAI development team uses their own framework and agents for developing KubeRocketAI itself. This provides real-world validation of the framework's effectiveness while creating a feedback loop for continuous improvement. Unlike the agent definition stories, this story focuses on operational implementation and workflow validation, demonstrating the framework's practical value through self-use and establishing metrics for measuring framework effectiveness in a development environment.
