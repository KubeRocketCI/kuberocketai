## Dependencies

- **Stories 1.1-1.8 Complete**: Core agent definitions and CLI infrastructure required for customization field integration
- **ADR-012**: Agent Customization Field Enhancement decision implemented

## Story

**As a** Framework Developer,
**I want** the krci-ai tool to support the new mandatory `customization` field in agent schemas with validation and embedded asset updates,
**so that** the new version enforces schema compliance while developers can manually migrate existing agents to the enhanced schema.

## Acceptance Criteria

1. Agent JSON schema updated to include mandatory `customization` field with default empty string
2. Agent validation engine recognizes and validates customization field presence and format
3. Clear error messages provided when customization field is missing or malformed
4. Existing agent validation continues to work with enhanced schema
5. Embedded framework assets updated to include customization field in all agent examples
6. `krci-ai validate` command validates customization field in agent definitions
7. CLI validation provides specific feedback for customization field issues
8. Cross-platform validation functionality maintained for customization field
9. All embedded agent assets (architect, developer, pm, qa, ba) include customization field with empty string values
10. Embedded agent assets use standard behavior only (no custom bootstrap examples)
11. Framework asset consistency maintained across all embedded components with empty customization
12. Asset extraction and installation preserves customization field integrity

## Description

This story implements the mandatory `customization` field in agent schemas, enabling future extensibility while maintaining backward compatibility. Unlike the previous Epic 1 stories focused on manual framework usage, this story enhances the CLI tooling and validation infrastructure to support schema evolution. The implementation ensures all embedded framework assets include the new field while providing clear migration guidance for existing agents, establishing the foundation for future agent customization capabilities.

## Tasks/Subtasks

- [x] Task 1: Update Agent JSON Schema (AC: 1, 2, 3, 4)
  - [x] Add mandatory `customization` field to agent JSON schema with default empty string
  - [x] Update schema validation logic to require customization field presence
  - [x] Implement validation for customization field format and content
  - [x] Add specific error messages for customization field validation failures
  - [x] Test schema validation with agents including and missing customization field
- [x] Task 2: Enhance CLI Validation Engine (AC: 6, 7, 8)
  - [x] Update `krci-ai validate` command to check customization field presence
  - [x] Implement customization field format validation in CLI validation engine
  - [x] Add clear error reporting for customization field issues
  - [x] Ensure cross-platform compatibility for customization field validation
  - [x] Test CLI validation with various customization field scenarios
- [x] Task 3: Update Embedded Framework Assets (AC: 5, 9, 10, 11, 12)
  - [x] Add customization field with empty string values to all embedded agent assets (architect, developer, pm, qa, ba)
  - [x] Ensure all embedded agents use standard behavior only (empty customization field)
  - [x] Update embedded asset generation to include customization field with empty default
  - [x] Verify asset extraction preserves customization field in all scenarios
  - [x] Test embedded asset integrity with customization field across platforms
