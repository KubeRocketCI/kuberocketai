## Dependencies

- **Stories 1.1-1.7**: Require agent definitions, CLI functionality, and dogfooding insights to document accurately

## Story

**As a** framework adopter, **I want** essential framework introduction and asset creation guidance, **so that** I can quickly get started with the KubeRocketAI framework and begin adding my own assets manually.

## Acceptance Criteria

1. Framework introduction explains core concepts (agents, tasks, templates, data) clearly
2. Asset creation guide enables manual creation of agents with format consistency
3. CLI installation instructions provide clear setup path
4. Getting started guide provides path from installation to first agent creation
5. Documentation focuses on essential framework adoption without CLI complexity

## Description

This story consolidates essential framework documentation to enable rapid adoption by new users. Unlike the implementation-focused stories, this focuses on creating clear, actionable guidance for framework adopters who need to understand core concepts and create their own assets manually. The documentation bridges the gap between framework architecture and practical usage, providing a clear path from installation to first agent creation without requiring deep CLI knowledge.

## Tasks/Subtasks

- [x] Task 1: Framework Introduction (AC: 1)
  - [x] Document core concepts: agents, tasks, templates, data in `docs/architecture/04-data-models.md`
  - [x] Create framework overview with progressive complexity explanation
  - [x] Document manual-first approach for Epic 1
- [x] Task 2: Asset Creation Guide (AC: 2, 4)
  - [x] Create manual agent creation guide with format consistency
  - [x] Document agent examples from Stories 1.1-1.5
  - [x] Create step-by-step guide from concept to working agent
- [x] Task 3: CLI Installation Guide (AC: 3, 4)
  - [x] Document CLI installation via Homebrew
  - [x] Create getting started guide: installation → first agent creation
  - [x] Focus on essential usage without advanced features
