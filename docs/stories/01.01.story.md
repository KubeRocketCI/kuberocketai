## Dependencies

- **None**: Foundation story for Epic 1 agent definitions

## Story

**As a** Software Architect,
**I want** a complete architect agent framework with system design capabilities including agent definition, structured tasks, output templates, and reference data,
**so that** I can immediately use KubeRocketAI for comprehensive architectural analysis and guidance with consistent outputs.

## Acceptance Criteria

### Agent Asset

1. `architect.yaml` agent is created with system design and architecture guidance capabilities *(Updated: YAML format)*
2. Agent includes Mermaid diagram generation capabilities
3. Agent has comprehensive architectural analysis and design prompts
4. Agent works effectively in Cursor (@agent) and Claude Code (/agent)
5. Agent behavioral guidelines and reference patterns are defined
6. Agent follows established format with identity grouping for consistency ([Source](docs/architecture/04-data-models.md)) *(Enhanced: Identity structure)*

### Task Assets

7. Core architectural tasks are created with procedural workflows *(Implemented: YAML format)*
8. Tasks include `analyze-requirements`, `create-system-design`, `review-architecture` capabilities
9. Tasks reference templates and data assets using inline `[filename](path)` markdown links
10. Tasks follow established format for consistency ([Source](docs/architecture/04-data-models.md))

### Template Assets

11. Output templates are created for consistent architectural documentation
12. Templates include `requirements-analysis.md`, `system-design.md`, `architecture-review.md`
13. Templates use variable placeholders (`{{variable_name}}`) for dynamic content
14. Templates follow established format for consistency ([Source](docs/architecture/04-data-models.md))

### Data Assets

15. Reference data is created for architectural guidelines and standards
16. Data includes `architecture-principles.md`, `design-patterns.md`, `security-framework.md`
17. Data assets are organized by purpose (behavioral for agents, technical for tasks)
18. Data follows established format for consistency ([Source](docs/architecture/04-data-models.md))

### Integration & Testing

19. All four asset types work together in the progressive complexity model
20. Basic IDE usage is tested and documented with all asset types

### Validation Infrastructure *(Added: Professional validation tooling)*

21. JSON Schema created for agent validation with identity grouping support
22. Professional validation tool developed with automatic .venv setup
23. Comprehensive validation including schema compliance and framework rules
24. Cross-platform validation tooling with clear error reporting
25. Documentation and usage examples for validation workflow

## Description

This foundational story establishes the architect agent framework as the first complete implementation of the KubeRocketAI four-asset-type model (agent, tasks, templates, data). The architect agent serves as the pattern-setter for subsequent agent development in Epic 1, demonstrating the complete progressive complexity model from Level 1 (agent-only) through Level 4 (agent + tasks + templates + data).

**Story Context**: As the foundation story for Epic 1's baseline agent framework, this story creates not just an architect agent, but the entire architectural framework infrastructure including validation tooling, schema definitions, and integration patterns. The architect agent focuses on system design capabilities, Mermaid diagram generation, and comprehensive architectural analysis, providing immediate value for software architects while establishing development patterns for the PM, Developer, QA, and BA agents in subsequent stories.

**Business Value**: This story enables software architects to immediately adopt KubeRocketAI for architectural tasks while providing the foundational patterns that enable rapid development of the remaining four agents in Epic 1, accelerating the overall baseline delivery timeline.
