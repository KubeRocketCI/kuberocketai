## Dependencies

**Blocking:**

- Story 08.02 (depends on core installation functionality)

**Blocked By:**

- Epic 1: KubeRocketAI Baseline (core CLI infrastructure)
- Epic 2: Core Engine (dependency resolution capabilities)

**System/Test Dependencies:**

- Golang 1.24+ runtime environment
- File system write permissions for `.krci-ai/` directory
- Embedded framework assets for offline installation

## Story

**As a** Developer,
**I want** to install specific agents using the same flexible syntax as bundle commands (comma or space separated),
**so that** I can customize my team's framework setup without unnecessary bloat and maintain CLI consistency.

## Acceptance Criteria

1. Single agent installation with dependency resolution
   - Scenario: Given a valid agent name, when I run single agent installation command, then only the specified agent and its required dependencies are installed
   - Expected Behavior: Installation creates .krci-ai directory with only requested agent and dependency files; no extra agents installed
   - Verification Command: `krci-ai install --agent developer && find .krci-ai/agents -name "*.yaml" | wc -l` (Expect: exit 0, count = 1)
   - Evidence: Command output showing successful installation and directory listing
   - Non-automatable at story-level: false
   - Files Created/Changed: `.krci-ai/agents/developer.yaml`, `.krci-ai/tasks/*.md` (dependencies)
   - Guardrails: Installation completes in <= 10s; no P0/P1 errors; maintains directory structure consistency
   - Test Data/Fixtures: Embedded agent definitions in binary
   - Environment/Flags: None required
   - Traceability: Epic AC #1; BR13

2. Multi-agent installation using flexible syntax (matches bundle command)
   - Scenario: Given multiple valid agent names, when I run installation with comma-separated or space-separated syntax, then all specified agents and dependencies are installed
   - Expected Behavior: Exactly specified agents installed with proper dependency resolution; supports both "pm,architect,developer" and "pm architect developer" formats
   - Verification Command: `krci-ai install --agent pm,architect,developer && find .krci-ai/agents -name "*.yaml" | wc -l` (Expect: exit 0, count = 3)
   - Evidence: Directory listing showing all requested agents and verification of both comma and space-separated parsing
   - Non-automatable at story-level: false
   - Files Created/Changed: `.krci-ai/agents/pm.yaml`, `.krci-ai/agents/architect.yaml`, `.krci-ai/agents/developer.yaml`, related task files
   - Guardrails: All agents installed successfully or rollback on failure; no orphaned dependencies; both parsing formats work identically
   - Test Data/Fixtures: Multiple agent definitions; test both "pm,architect" and "pm architect" formats
   - Environment/Flags: None required
   - Traceability: Epic AC #2; BR14

3. Dependency resolution validation
   - Scenario: Given agents with task dependencies, when selective installation occurs, then all required tasks and data files are included automatically
   - Expected Behavior: Agent functionality preserved through complete dependency chain installation
   - Verification Command: `krci-ai validate --agent developer` (Expect: exit 0, "validation passed")
   - Evidence: Validation output confirming all dependencies satisfied
   - Non-automatable at story-level: false
   - Files Created/Changed: All dependency files as specified in agent configurations
   - Guardrails: No broken references; agent remains fully functional post-installation
   - Test Data/Fixtures: Agent configurations with multi-level dependencies
   - Environment/Flags: None required
   - Traceability: Epic dependency requirements; BR13, BR14

4. Installation error handling and rollback
   - Scenario: Given an invalid agent name or installation failure, when installation is attempted, then clear error message is shown and system remains clean
   - Expected Behavior: Graceful failure with actionable error message; no partial installation state
   - Verification Command: `krci-ai install --agent invalid_agent` (Expect: exit 1, error message in stderr)
   - Evidence: Error output and verification of clean filesystem state
   - Non-automatable at story-level: false
   - Files Created/Changed: None (clean rollback)
   - Guardrails: No corrupted state; clear error messaging; complete rollback on failure
   - Test Data/Fixtures: Invalid agent names and corrupted scenarios
   - Environment/Flags: None required
   - Traceability: NFR-UX1, NFR-REL

## Description

Implements core selective installation functionality for KubeRocketAI, enabling Developers to install only required agents. Uses existing bundle command patterns for consistent CLI experience and maintains full compatibility with validation systems.

The implementation reuses proven parsing logic, integrates seamlessly with existing architecture, and introduces clean SOLID abstractions for maintainable code. Includes critical bug fix for recursive subdirectory dependency resolution.

## Tasks/Subtasks

- [x] **Task 1: Implement CLI interface with selective installation flags (AC: 1, 2)**

  - [x] Integrated ParseAgentList() from bundle command for consistent parsing
  - [x] Added validation logic for agent names and task filtering
  - [x] Run: `make ci` (Success: all CI checks pass)

- [x] **Task 2: Create AssetSource abstraction for SOLID architecture (AC: 3)**
  - [x] Create file: `internal/assets/source.go` - AssetSource interface and implementations

  - [x] Validation: `krci-ai validate` (Success: exit 0, no broken links)

- [x] **Task 4: Apply Go best practices and code quality improvements**
  - [x] Applied Go naming conventions for exported vs unexported constants

## Implementation Results

**Created Files**:

**Modified Files**:

- `cmd/krci-ai/cmd/install.go` - Added `--agent`, `--agents`, `--task` flags with validation
